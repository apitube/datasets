Now [they’re] on a Hyrule wide bug hunt.” It’s amazing that stories like these can still come out of this game, even if a lot of folks have moved on.\nBut what about the missed connections, or abandoned quests?\nFor me, it’s the Zelda: Breath of the Wild Korok Seeds\nI know! I 100%ed the game otherwise (all items that I know of\/shrines): everything except the Korok Seeds. I was going to do it (and made good progress before guides were invented!), but once I saw the reward, I just couldn’t go through with it.\nGrowing up, I always had a certain degree of satisfaction 100%ing games. Not every game was “worthy” of it, in that sense, but the ones I really connected to, I did go for it. But the real cherry on top of that sometimes grueling walk to that sundae was the reward. In character action games, it was occasionally a new costume or some insane toggle that fundamentally transformed the game in some way. That’s enough for me.\nBut 900 Zelda: Breath of the Wild Korok Seeds with no real reward? That’s where I check out!\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChris Carter\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tReviews Director, Co-EIC - Chris has been enjoying Destructoid avidly since 2008.

The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/18\/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california\/?guccounter=1\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch Disrupt.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news\/\" target=\"_blank\">left the publisher in the fall of 2021<\/a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.<\/p>\n<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/2Jhfofq-ehw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things<\/em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/18\/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california\/?guccounter=1\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix to expand into cloud gaming, opens new studio in Southern California [TechCrunch]<\/a><\/p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<p><img alt src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/av-96x96.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/av-192x192.jpg 2x\" \/>\t\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span>Chris Moyse<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span>Senior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

Much of the same development team that worked on Marvel’s Spider-Man is returning, including creative director Bryan Intihar and game director Ryan Smith.\nSchneider also confirms that Tony Todd, of Candyman fame, will be voicing Venom, and that Yuri Lowenthal and Nadji Jeter will be reprising their roles as Peter Parker and Miles Morales.\n\nThe first Marvel’s Spider-Man was a pretty big hit for the PlayStation 4 back in 2018, and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales carried the torch forward into the PlayStation 5 era. It’s not a huge surprise to see the Spidey franchise continue production, though it’s heartening to see both Peter and Miles getting the focus in this trailer. And with Venom, the Spider-family looks like it will keep on growing.\nMarvel’s Spider-Man 2 is set for sometime in 2023.\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tOverwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs\nNetflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.\nThe new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.\n\nIn addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.\nThe newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.\n\nFor the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.\nNetflix to expand into cloud gaming, opens new studio in Southern California [TechCrunch]\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChris Moyse\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

The announcement was made by publisher Microids, which is collaborating with Moulinsart – the company responsible for curating the Tintin IP – to bring the boy reporter’s antics to PC and consoles.\nFor uncultured swines, The Adventures of Tintin was a comic drawn and written by Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, better known by his nom-de-plume Hergé. Running in various publications from the late 1920s to the 1970s, The Adventures of Tintin detailed the escapades of a young Belgian reporter as he investigated international crimes and mysteries, fighting corruption and injustice with his trousers tucked into his socks.\nAccompanied by his dog Snowy and unsteady seafarer Captain Haddock, Tintin’s exploits often land him in hot water, with his journeys taking him to far-off locations such as the pyramids of Egypt, the jungles of Africa, and even into outer space. Over the years, The Adventures of Tintin has been adapted into several TV series, and hit the big screen in 2011 via CGI movie Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn. Tintin has also featured in several video games, including 1989’s Tintin On the Moon, and 1995’s Tintin in Tibet.\nDescribed by Microids as an action-adventure title, The Adventures of Tintin will “transport the player into a whirlwind of incredible situations and suspense,” and will feature other popular series characters, including the finicky Professor Calculus and dopey twin detectives Thomson &amp; Thompson.\nThe Adventures of Tintin is currently in pre-development for PC and consoles.\n\n \n\nSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.\nThe new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.\n\nIn addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.\nThe newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.\n\nFor the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.\nNetflix to expand into cloud gaming, opens new studio in Southern California [TechCrunch]\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChris Moyse\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

Benzies, the former head of Rockstar North and a longtime producer of the studio’s biggest games, alleges that he was forced out of the company and is owed $150 million in unpaid royalties. The judicial system doesn’t agree with that claim.<\/p>\n<p>Benzies’ case mostly relies on a royalty agreement that escalated him to “Rockstar Principal” — a small group of key players who are most responsible for the companies success. The agreement is essentially a profit sharing arrangement meant to provide extra compensation to Benzies and Rockstar co-founders Sam and Dan Houser. Benzies argues the Housers were given more money than him during his 17-month sabbatical.<\/p>\n<p>However, as reported by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamesindustry.biz\/articles\/2018-04-09-former-gta-producer-suffers-setback-in-usd150m-lawsuit-against-take-two\" target=\"_blank\">GamesIndustry.biz<\/a>, the New York Supreme Court recently ruled that Rockstar does not owe Benzies $150 million. Its interpretation of the contract finds that there’s no language suggesting mandatory equal payments, and that it only accounts for “discretionary royalty payments.” This makes the agreement seem like a good faith-based arrangement that’s meant to compensate bonuses whenever Rockstar feels they’re warranted.<\/p>\n<p>All is not lost for Benzies, though. The court also ruled he is still entitled to certain royalties that went unpaid. Benzies also successfully argued that there was a breach in his employment agreement that revolves around salary and stock options. It’s likely that Benzies will squeeze some more money out of Rockstar before it’s all said and done. He just won’t squeeze out $150 million.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamesindustry.biz\/articles\/2018-04-09-former-gta-producer-suffers-setback-in-usd150m-lawsuit-against-take-two\" target=\"_blank\">Former GTA producer suffers setback in $150m lawsuit against Take Two<\/a> [GamesIndustry.biz]<\/p>\n<div>\n<p><img alt src=\"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/cdd0ff268a753f3df321649497649282?s=96&amp;r=g\" srcset=\"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/cdd0ff268a753f3df321649497649282?s=192&amp;r=g 2x\" \/> <\/p>\n<div>\n<p><span>While you laughing, we're passing, passing away.\nSo y'all go rest y'all souls,\n'Cause I know I'ma meet you up at the crossroads.\nY'all know y'all forever got love from them Bone Thugs baby...<\/span>\n<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>",

The judicial system doesn’t agree with that claim.\nBenzies’ case mostly relies on a royalty agreement that escalated him to “Rockstar Principal” — a small group of key players who are most responsible for the companies success. The agreement is essentially a profit sharing arrangement meant to provide extra compensation to Benzies and Rockstar co-founders Sam and Dan Houser. Benzies argues the Housers were given more money than him during his 17-month sabbatical.\nHowever, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz, the New York Supreme Court recently ruled that Rockstar does not owe Benzies $150 million. Its interpretation of the contract finds that there’s no language suggesting mandatory equal payments, and that it only accounts for “discretionary royalty payments.” This makes the agreement seem like a good faith-based arrangement that’s meant to compensate bonuses whenever Rockstar feels they’re warranted.\nAll is not lost for Benzies, though. The court also ruled he is still entitled to certain royalties that went unpaid. Benzies also successfully argued that there was a breach in his employment agreement that revolves around salary and stock options. It’s likely that Benzies will squeeze some more money out of Rockstar before it’s all said and done. He just won’t squeeze out $150 million.\nFormer GTA producer suffers setback in $150m lawsuit against Take Two [GamesIndustry.biz]\n\n \n\nWhile you laughing, we're passing, passing away.\nSo y'all go rest y'all souls,\n'Cause I know I'ma meet you up at the crossroads.\nY'all know y'all forever got love from them Bone Thugs baby...\n\n\n\n\n",

In between releases, it’s always been fun for me to put the pieces together, theorize, and then ultimately see Capcom take a different direction than the clues might’ve suggested. A new quote out of Tokyo Game Show 2022 has rekindled the conversation, specifically with respect to the upcoming <em>Shadows of Rose<\/em> DLC for <em>Resident Evil Village<\/em> and where the series could go with the next mainline entry.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ign.com\/articles\/resident-evil-villages-shadows-of-rose-dlc-will-conclude-the-winters-family-saga\" target=\"_blank\">As reported by IGN out of Tokyo Game Show<\/a>, director Kento Kinoshita says that Capcom is “creating the <em>Shadows of Rose<\/em> story to conclude the Winters family saga.”<\/p>\n<p>A short and open-ended but very thought-provoking quote, to be sure.<\/p>\n<p>Without spoiling anything, this remark changes my expectations for what kind of story <em>Resident Evil 9<\/em> (reminder: we don’t have an actual name yet so that’s just shorthand) might tell. (That closing <em>Village<\/em> scene was a head-turner at the time.) Now I’m even less sure about what to expect — just unresolved bits and pieces that were seeded in <em>Village<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Is it time for old favorites to shine again? To bury <a href=\"https:\/\/residentevil.fandom.com\/wiki\/Blue_Umbrella\" target=\"_blank\">Umbrella<\/a> once and for all?

Players must explore and survive a warped and mysterious realm inside the consciousness of the Megamycete in search of a cure.”<\/p>\n<p>Some fans, who have had enough of Ethan’s “everyman” antics across <em>Resident Evil 7<\/em> and <em>Village<\/em>, are hopeful that <em>Resident Evil 9<\/em> will combine the old and the new. Personally, as much as I do want to see Jill Valentine (or others!) back in action, particularly after digging her refreshed characterization in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/reviews\/review-resident-evil-3-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Resident Evil 3<\/em><\/a> remake, I like the Winters storyline and would’ve been fine seeing it wrapped up in the next game. As is, I’m wondering if this DLC will feel significant enough for people like me, or if it’ll seem shoehorned.<\/p>\n<p>We’ll find out what’s going down on October 28, when <em>Shadows of Rose<\/em> debuts as part of <em>Resident Evil Village Gold Edition<\/em> and the <em>Winters’ Expansion<\/em>. My Halloween plans are set.<\/p>\n<p>I’ll also be back in for the new third-person mode. According to producer Masachika Kawata, the mode “took about as much effort as creating a new game” due to the “exceptionally large variety of player actions” in <em>Resident Evil Village<\/em> compared to <em>Resident Evil 2<\/em> and <em>3<\/em>. “You can guard, you can move while crouching, and there is a lot of examining objects.

                "textplain": "\nSo, who’s on deck for the next mainline game?\nResident Evil Village left us off on a wild note, with so much room to speculate about the near and long-term future of the series. In between releases, it’s always been fun for me to put the pieces together, theorize, and then ultimately see Capcom take a different direction than the clues might’ve suggested. A new quote out of Tokyo Game Show 2022 has rekindled the conversation, specifically with respect to the upcoming Shadows of Rose DLC for Resident Evil Village and where the series could go with the next mainline entry.\nAs reported by IGN out of Tokyo Game Show, director Kento Kinoshita says that Capcom is “creating the Shadows of Rose story to conclude the Winters family saga.”\nA short and open-ended but very thought-provoking quote, to be sure.\nWithout spoiling anything, this remark changes my expectations for what kind of story Resident Evil 9 (reminder: we don’t have an actual name yet so that’s just shorthand) might tell. (That closing Village scene was a head-turner at the time.) Now I’m even less sure about what to expect — just unresolved bits and pieces that were seeded in Village.\nIs it time for old favorites to shine again? To bury Umbrella once and for all? Once we know the core playable cast and setting, we’ll have a much better picture.\nI hope the DLC doesn’t feel like too much of a retread.\nJumping ahead\nFor more context (Village plot spoilers), here’s how Capcom originally framed the Shadows of Rose DLC when it was announced: “Set 16 years after the events of Resident Evil Village, this new tale follows Rose Winters, the daughter of main protagonist Ethan, as she struggles with her terrifying powers. Players must explore and survive a warped and mysterious realm inside the consciousness of the Megamycete in search of a cure.”\nSome fans, who have had enough of Ethan’s “everyman” antics across Resident Evil 7 and Village, are hopeful that Resident Evil 9 will combine the old and the new. Personally, as much as I do want to see Jill Valentine (or others!) back in action, particularly after digging her refreshed characterization in the Resident Evil 3 remake, I like the Winters storyline and would’ve been fine seeing it wrapped up in the next game. As is, I’m wondering if this DLC will feel significant enough for people like me, or if it’ll seem shoehorned.\nWe’ll find out what’s going down on October 28, when Shadows of Rose debuts as part of Resident Evil Village Gold Edition and the Winters’ Expansion. My Halloween plans are set.\nI’ll also be back in for the new third-person mode. According to producer Masachika Kawata, the mode “took about as much effort as creating a new game” due to the “exceptionally large variety of player actions” in Resident Evil Village compared to Resident Evil 2 and 3. “You can guard, you can move while crouching, and there is a lot of examining objects. We made thorough adjustments to ensure that those unique animations would look completely connected, and that it would be playable at a good tempo.”\n\n \n\nJordan is a founding member of Destructoid and poster of seemingly random pictures. They are anything but random.\n\n\n\n",

Suit up for an all-new adventure on 10.25.22. #GothamKnights pic.twitter.com\/d7oV2LbcT8\n— Gotham Knights (@GothamKnights) March 9, 2022\nThe set-up of Gotham Knights is that Batman is dead (presumably), and his many protégés must take up the Bat-Mantle and fight the evildoers of Gotham in his stead. It’s an action game that takes after the Batman: Arkham series, but with character-specific moves and abilities in play.\nThe four playable heroes are Robin, Batgirl, Nightwing, and Red Hood. It’s also set to feature several Bat-verse villains—one of the early trailers centered around Mr. Freeze—but puts the Court of Owls at the center of the drama. The secret society is up to no good, and there’s a legion of angry owl-fighters to back them up.\n\nThose itching for some more heroic, Arkham-style adventures have been waiting patiently for more news on Gotham Knights. Now at least, the co-op brawler has set a date and looks to be one of the first big fall releases on the calendar. No doubt that timeframe will start to fill up as we get into the summer of game announcements, but Gotham Knights is getting out ahead of the pack and setting its sights on October 25.\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tThe image posting tool was removed this week\nThe 3DS and Wii U image posting tool was removed: which itself seems insignificant, but actually highlights the slow, and at times, absurd deaths of the systems.\nThe news comes straight from Nintendo’s Japanese customer service Twitter account, which states (translated): “Nintendo 3DS series and Wii U ‘image posting tool’ service ended today at 4:00 pm. Images from the Nintendo 3DS series and Wii U cannot be posted after. Images and comments posted on Facebook and Twitter can be viewed on each SNS even after the service ends.” The official end time was October 25 at 4PM JST. So it’s over!\nAs you may recall, both of these devices are on the way out, and are being completely disconnected from pretty much every service by 2023. Most of their online functionality was already ripped away, as we move toward the “March 2023” full end date when everything is gone.\nIt’s a shame. I get that legacy devices do need to end service at some point. But it’s funny to boot up some really old devices, and just….game on PC…and see a ton of online functionality alive and well, like nothing changed. I love the Wii U and 3DS to pieces, but the latter in particular has an incredible legacy that Nintendo should forever be proud of. I wish it could live on past March 2023.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChris Carter\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tReviews Director, Co-EIC - Chris has been enjoying Destructoid avidly since 2008.

The cream was sinking to the bottom while the turds rose to the top. It’s enough to make you want to throw in the blood-soaked, stinking towel.<\/p>\n<p>But there were many, many games that kept that towel soft and warm. Just playing games, as opposed to writing about them, talking about them, or thinking about them, did more to keep me going in 2021 than any other in my adult life. My total playtime with games was five times longer in 2021 than it was in 2020. Some of that was coping. Some of it was also keeping my kid engaged when he couldn’t play with his friends. But most of all, it was a way to make a deep connection with the people who made the games through their work, in a year when connection was in short supply.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the games of 2021 that did the best job of that.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Astalon-2.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" alt \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>My favorite surprise of 2021: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nintendo.com\/games\/detail\/astalon-tears-of-the-earth-switch\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Astalon: Tears of Earth<\/em><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I’m a sucker for games that are made by small teams, and they don’t get much smaller than LABS Works.

It’s harder than you might think. In a year that was already filled with massive problems to solve, there weren’t many days when, come 7 p.m., my brain was energized with great ideas on how to explain why a “10” is actually “ten ones” and not “a one next to a zero”.  The hardest, and also most interesting, thing about trying to teach a kid something new is you can only rely on the knowledge they already have for context.<\/p>\n<p>You’re also restricted by their limited list of motivations. You can’t squeeze blood from a stone, and you can’t get a person whose brain naturally wanders towards blowing up monsters in <em>Dusk<\/em> (the boomer shooter) instead of tips and tricks on how to add up to solutions higher than 20. One night he announced “I want a game with monsters, where you don’t see the character you play, and you kill the monsters. That’s all I’m going to do.” He was putting me to task.<\/p>\n<p>After searching the Switch eShop store for a few minutes, I found a game that met his criteria. <em>S.U.M. Slay Uncool Monsters<\/em> met all his criteria, and it also taught the boy basic addition and subtraction (it also has the option to do multiplication and division, but we’re not there yet). There were many times I wondered if I was making the right choices in 2021. Should I have let him even play a bit of <em>Dusk, No More Heroes 3<\/em> (with the swears turned off), <em>Axiom Verge 2, and Metroid Dread, <\/em>or would they give him nightmares for life? Should I have instead been engaging in non-nightmarish, fatherly fun like tossing around the football and telling him about how good vegetables are for his skin? Or is that its own kind of nightmare?<\/p>\n<p>I’ll never know for sure, but I have no doubt that we shared some virtual adventures that we’ll never forget, and that at least one of them made him way better than his friends at basic addition and subtraction.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Metroid-Dread-Central-Unit-Fight.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" alt \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>My favorite “It’s great but I wish it was even better” game of 2021: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/reviews\/review-metroid-dread\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Metroid Dread<\/em><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Metroid Dread<\/em> is the franchise’s <em>Force Awakens<\/em>. It sticks to the formula to a fault, calling back to all the surface-level things that fans praise in the series while shaving off all the rough edges that may not appeal to modern audiences. The problem for me is, those rough edges are exactly why the series has stuck with me all those years. My ideal<em> Metroid<\/em> moment-to-moment steps are: 1) Be thrust into an illogical, alien world 2) Get stuck 3) Experiment with new things (tools, techniques, and or strategies) 4) Discover what works 5) Master what you’ve discovered 6) Repeat.<\/p>\n<p>There was definitely some of that in <em>Metroid Dread<\/em>, but the developers’ urge to turn Samus into “The Badass Action Hero that you know from the<em> Smash Bros.<\/em> series”  instead of a “plodding, slow jumping astronaut with little mainstream appeal” led <em>Dread<\/em> to feel more like a 2D <em>Bayonetta<\/em> title than anything else. And that’s not a bad thing! I really had fun with <em>Dread<\/em>. It just wasn’t a full return to the things about the series I really love. I didn’t get lost once! Everything was so clearly signposted. I also rarely felt afraid or intimidated. After getting killed by a boss or an E.M.M.I. a few times, their tells and patterns became clear, and they all became pretty easy to beat. And that’s cool! It’s nice to see Samus be fully empowered early on for a change.<\/p>\n<p>It’s also a relief to see her finally win her psychological battles. More so than any other game in the series, <em>Dread<\/em> shows Samus come to terms with her trauma. In the end, <strong>(Spoilers)<\/strong> she fully embraces the ways others have altered her, and the rage she feels about it, and masters it all. Self-acceptance is a beautiful thing, and it was very loving of Nintendo and Mercury Steam to want to give that gift, and many others, to their #1 Sci-Fi Action star. It’s just that in order to also make the game a crowd-pleaser, they made <em>Dread<\/em> a sweet, super-powered breeze instead of the confounding storm of escape rooms that I grew up with.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/skatebird.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" alt \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>My “I heard it wasn’t great but it’s actually amazing” game of 2021: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/reviews\/review-skatebird\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>SkateBIRD<\/em><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When you love someone, their imperfections look beautiful. You can see why other people may not feel the same way about them, but you wouldn’t change them for the world. That’s how I feel about <em>SkateBIRD<\/em>. I get that, especially pre-patch, the game felt chunky and tough to grasp. But that’s exactly how real skateboarding feels for me, a 45-year old man who has definitely ollied once, but it was a long time ago. Even then, it really may have been more of a half-olly that mostly failed. At this point, who’s to say?<\/p>\n<p><em>SkateBIRD<\/em> embraces that kind of subjectivity. Come to think of it, there are a few ways that it feels more like classic <em>Metroid<\/em> than even <em>Dread<\/em> does. Instead of being a human with bird alien DNA trying to navigate through a bird alien hideout, you’re a bird wearing people clothes trying to do people things. The world of humans is not built for you, but with the right mix of tenacity and curiosity, you can go places you never thought possible, pulling off moves once thought unthinkable.<\/p>\n<p>And that soundtrack! Imagine the music from <em>Jet Set Radio<\/em>, but with samples of bird-obsessed scientists awing at a majestic <a href=\"https:\/\/madsenstudios.bandcamp.com\/track\/the-heron\" target=\"_blank\">Heron Gull one minute<\/a>, and a confident young lad declaring that <a href=\"https:\/\/wearetheunion.bandcamp.com\/track\/goin-down-the-road-feelin-bad\" target=\"_blank\">the president is a racist transphobe<\/a> the next. It’s truly an album for the ages.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/GTA-bikini-1.jpg?resize=640%2C342\" alt \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>My favorite “I heard it was bad but I wish it was even worse” game of 2021: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/reviews\/review-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-ps5-version\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition<\/em><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I cannot legitimately enjoy the <em>GTA<\/em> series. I have tried and tried, but on the whole, they just feel bad. I don’t think I would like the people that came up with them. It feels like they don’t even like video games that much. Sure, they like what games can <em>do<\/em>, but instead of embracing the surreality, the creativity, and the heart of the medium, they just want to recreate Quentin Tarantino’s ’90s movies. They want to let you be a sociopath who… loves to explore? I don’t get it. Playing 3D <em>GTA<\/em> games feels like working a boring-but-demanding job for asshole bosses, all at the cost of doing anything worthwhile with your time (and from some accounts, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamesindustry.biz\/articles\/2018-10-26-rockstars-broken-work-ethics\" target=\"_blank\">making them feel that way too<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I’ve felt pretty alone with that opinion for the past 20 years or so. For a long time, it felt like there were two kinds of people in this world; the ones who steer clear of “<em>Grand Theft Auto<\/em>” because it sounds like a deep dive into the dank dumpster of our collective cultural consciousness, and the ones who can’t wait to take that dip. The folks in the first group usually think all video games are trash. That’s definitely not me. The folks in the second group usually have an attraction to being the “bad guy” in games. That’s not me either! So that’s been my pickle for the past two decades.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/face.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" alt \/><\/p>\n<p>For the record, I also like the<em> Star Wars<\/em> prequels, hate <em>Space Jam<\/em>, and think that the N64 is Nintendo’s worst console by a country mile. For a long time, people thought I was a dunce for these opinions as well, but for whatever reason, time seems to have brought many over to my way of thinking. Apparently, the prequels are cool again,<em> Space Jam<\/em> is largely recognized to be an overwrought McDonald’s commercial, and people think N64 games look terrible! Welcome to my brain, everyone!<\/p>\n<p>And that’s exactly how I felt when I saw how much people hated the recently released <em>GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition<\/em>. “Hey, this game looks like crap…” Yeah, they always have! “These missions are repetitive and dull…” Yes! Always has been again! “The rain in this game looks like bukkake…”<\/p>\n<p>Well, that one’s new, but it’s definitely still on-brand.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/rain.webp?resize=640%2C360\" alt \/><\/p>\n<p>These three remastered <em>GTA<\/em> games looked like cheap cash grabs, unloved and uncared about. That felt honest to me. A series about stealing stuff for easy money was trying to get away with a criminally shitty “definitive” version of their “classic titles”. Even better, they were so broken that they finally felt like video games again. Human faces suddenly appear in walls, cars grow to massive sizes for no reason, and people trash-talk before blasting off into space. Purely by accident, <em>GTA<\/em> had finally gotten weird and silly, and had become a worthwhile self-parody in the process. I was ready to buy the physical Switch port (the <em>most<\/em> broken version) on day one, just for laughs.<\/p>\n<p>Then it was delayed indefinitely, as the publisher was surely aghast at these games finally getting the low review scores they always deserved. It’s a bummer that, after <em>GTA<\/em> finally went to being “so bad it’s good” from “so bad it’s boring” that Rockstar is undoubtedly trying to make them blander again. But who knows, maybe they will go full Cruelty Squad with the Switch port when it’s finally sold on the cartridge. One can hope.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/hero.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" alt \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>My favorite small game of the year: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/reviews\/review-mon-amour-nintendo-switch-pc\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mon Amour<\/em><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At the same time, I was feeling alone with my dislike of the <em>GTA<\/em> games on the PS2, I was falling in love with another open-world game on the console: <em>Chulip<\/em>, the exploration and kissing game. It was everything that <em>GTA<\/em> wasn’t: cute, funny, kind, and quick to punish you for stepping out of line. And in this game, you’re in line for a smooch!<\/p>\n<p>Once again, history has proven my weird taste in games to be the correct one. <em>Chulip<\/em> is now worth a bunch of money on the resale market, and people much smarter and more interesting than I talk about how great it is all the time. The creator of the game has taken notice as well. His latest game, <em>Mon Amour<\/em>, returns to <em>Chulip<\/em>‘s smooching concept but makes it a simple <em>Flappy Bird-<\/em>esque arcade game. That doesn’t sound that great, does it? But it is! The music, the graphics, the comedy, all top-notch, but my favorite thing about the game is the way if feels. In real life, it’s hard to know if you’re doing things right, and that goes double for moving in for your first kiss. <em>Mon Amour<\/em> replicates that feeling of “moving forward cautiously, following your instincts, but ready to fail at any moment” perfectly. Subjectively, it’s perfect.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/AV2.jpg?resize=640%2C320\" alt \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>My favorite medium-sized game of 2021: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/reviews\/review-axiom-verge-2\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Axiom Verge 2<\/em><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Axiom Verge 2<\/em> is also about boldly moving into the unknown. At the start, it’s not a lot like the first game, eschewing old-school <em>Metroid<\/em> aesthetics for a more athletic, organic exercise. It’s about a new lead character doing new things in a new place, and while lore-hounds for the first game will find plenty of allusions to the original, this game definitely didn’t need to be called <em>Axiom Verge 2<\/em>. In fact, calling it that was a pretty big risk, at least from a marketing perspective. But the risk paid off, and in the end, it makes sense.<\/p>\n<p>Just as the original <em>Axiom Verge<\/em> was, intentionally or not, an accurate reflection of the one-person development team’s psyche, the sequel catches us up with where Tom Happ, the creator of the franchise, is in his life today. He’s a dad now, working to create both a good life for his kid with one hand and to make even better games than he has before with the other. The path to meet both goals is indelibly intertwined. He can’t make money for his family if he doesn’t make good games, and he can’t make good games unless he creates honest work that could only come from him.<\/p>\n<p>I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entirety of my playtime with <em>Axiom Verge 2<\/em>, waiting to see exactly if, and how, Tom would pull off this dual aim. In the end, he nailed it. My only complaint about the game is there isn’t more of it. When the credits finally rolled, I was not ready to quit. Then again, that’s true of just about every one of the games on this list. Thankfully, most of them are sure to get some sort of sequel and\/or DLC expansion at some point. They all did pretty well, so we probably won’t have to say goodbye to them anytime soon.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/travis.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" alt \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>My favorite big game of 2021: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/reviews\/review-no-more-heroes-3\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>No More Heroes 3<\/em><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I can’t believe this is goodbye! <em>No More Heroes 3<\/em> has so many hints of where the series could go from here, from movie adaptations by Takashi Miike to <em>Back to the Future<\/em>-style forays into the far-flung foibles of Travis’s offspring. <strong>(SPOILERS)<\/strong> I mean, he cuts his brother in half, and like five minutes later, is decapitated by him! And we still don’t know exactly how why! This can’t be the end, can it?<\/p>\n<p>It is.<\/p>\n<p>In retrospect, you can tell Suda51 was planning to make this the last game in the series. Last episodes of TV shows often swing for the fences in the same way. For a series, all the episodes before the final one have a specific job to do; to get you to want to watch the next one. The last episode doesn’t have to pursue the audience in the same way. It exists in a time where there’s no tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/8wVs3NDHRAs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>For <em>Quantum Leap<\/em>, that meant capping things off with a bunch of small talk among characters you’d never seen before. For Jim Henson’s <em>Dinosaurs<\/em>, it meant bringing a heavenly Apocolypse down to Earth. For <em>No More Heroes 3<\/em>, it meant all that and more. We’ve heard that even more magic was planned for the game, and fans will always wonder what could have been, but there is no doubting that this is the fullest, most fun entry in the series. Just as our old pal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZoQ1PjMdCeE\" target=\"_blank\">Jirard “The Completionist” Khalil<\/a>. He put hundreds of hours into the game and is one of the few people in the world to truly see it all.<\/p>\n<p>Someday, I might see it all too. <em>No More Heroes 3<\/em> is a game I plan to play for the rest of my days. It’s broken in all the right ways while fixing all of the things that were less than perfect about its predecessors. More importantly, it loves <em>No More Heroes, <\/em>and its fans, with all its heart. In a year where it was easy to lose sight of what was good, games like this reminded me why I love the medium, and I’m grateful for it.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p><img alt src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Jonathan-Holmes-avatar-96x96.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Jonathan-Holmes-avatar-192x192.jpg 2x\" \/> <\/p>\n<div>\n<p><span>\"Where do dreams end and reality begin?

That’s all I’m going to do.” He was putting me to task.\nAfter searching the Switch eShop store for a few minutes, I found a game that met his criteria. S.U.M. Slay Uncool Monsters met all his criteria, and it also taught the boy basic addition and subtraction (it also has the option to do multiplication and division, but we’re not there yet). There were many times I wondered if I was making the right choices in 2021. Should I have let him even play a bit of Dusk, No More Heroes 3 (with the swears turned off), Axiom Verge 2, and Metroid Dread, or would they give him nightmares for life? Should I have instead been engaging in non-nightmarish, fatherly fun like tossing around the football and telling him about how good vegetables are for his skin? Or is that its own kind of nightmare?\nI’ll never know for sure, but I have no doubt that we shared some virtual adventures that we’ll never forget, and that at least one of them made him way better than his friends at basic addition and subtraction.\n\nMy favorite “It’s great but I wish it was even better” game of 2021: Metroid Dread\nMetroid Dread is the franchise’s Force Awakens. It sticks to the formula to a fault, calling back to all the surface-level things that fans praise in the series while shaving off all the rough edges that may not appeal to modern audiences. The problem for me is, those rough edges are exactly why the series has stuck with me all those years. My ideal Metroid moment-to-moment steps are: 1) Be thrust into an illogical, alien world 2) Get stuck 3) Experiment with new things (tools, techniques, and or strategies) 4) Discover what works 5) Master what you’ve discovered 6) Repeat.\nThere was definitely some of that in Metroid Dread, but the developers’ urge to turn Samus into “The Badass Action Hero that you know from the Smash Bros. series”  instead of a “plodding, slow jumping astronaut with little mainstream appeal” led Dread to feel more like a 2D Bayonetta title than anything else. And that’s not a bad thing! I really had fun with Dread. It just wasn’t a full return to the things about the series I really love. I didn’t get lost once! Everything was so clearly signposted. I also rarely felt afraid or intimidated. After getting killed by a boss or an E.M.M.I. a few times, their tells and patterns became clear, and they all became pretty easy to beat. And that’s cool! It’s nice to see Samus be fully empowered early on for a change.\nIt’s also a relief to see her finally win her psychological battles. More so than any other game in the series, Dread shows Samus come to terms with her trauma. In the end, (Spoilers) she fully embraces the ways others have altered her, and the rage she feels about it, and masters it all. Self-acceptance is a beautiful thing, and it was very loving of Nintendo and Mercury Steam to want to give that gift, and many others, to their #1 Sci-Fi Action star. It’s just that in order to also make the game a crowd-pleaser, they made Dread a sweet, super-powered breeze instead of the confounding storm of escape rooms that I grew up with.\n\nMy “I heard it wasn’t great but it’s actually amazing” game of 2021: SkateBIRD\nWhen you love someone, their imperfections look beautiful. You can see why other people may not feel the same way about them, but you wouldn’t change them for the world. That’s how I feel about SkateBIRD. I get that, especially pre-patch, the game felt chunky and tough to grasp. But that’s exactly how real skateboarding feels for me, a 45-year old man who has definitely ollied once, but it was a long time ago. Even then, it really may have been more of a half-olly that mostly failed. At this point, who’s to say?\nSkateBIRD embraces that kind of subjectivity. Come to think of it, there are a few ways that it feels more like classic Metroid than even Dread does. Instead of being a human with bird alien DNA trying to navigate through a bird alien hideout, you’re a bird wearing people clothes trying to do people things. The world of humans is not built for you, but with the right mix of tenacity and curiosity, you can go places you never thought possible, pulling off moves once thought unthinkable.\nAnd that soundtrack! Imagine the music from Jet Set Radio, but with samples of bird-obsessed scientists awing at a majestic Heron Gull one minute, and a confident young lad declaring that the president is a racist transphobe the next. It’s truly an album for the ages.\n\nMy favorite “I heard it was bad but I wish it was even worse” game of 2021: GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition\nI cannot legitimately enjoy the GTA series. I have tried and tried, but on the whole, they just feel bad. I don’t think I would like the people that came up with them. It feels like they don’t even like video games that much. Sure, they like what games can do, but instead of embracing the surreality, the creativity, and the heart of the medium, they just want to recreate Quentin Tarantino’s ’90s movies. They want to let you be a sociopath who… loves to explore? I don’t get it. Playing 3D GTA games feels like working a boring-but-demanding job for asshole bosses, all at the cost of doing anything worthwhile with your time (and from some accounts, making them feel that way too.)\nOf course, I’ve felt pretty alone with that opinion for the past 20 years or so. For a long time, it felt like there were two kinds of people in this world; the ones who steer clear of “Grand Theft Auto” because it sounds like a deep dive into the dank dumpster of our collective cultural consciousness, and the ones who can’t wait to take that dip. The folks in the first group usually think all video games are trash. That’s definitely not me. The folks in the second group usually have an attraction to being the “bad guy” in games. That’s not me either! So that’s been my pickle for the past two decades.\n\nFor the record, I also like the Star Wars prequels, hate Space Jam, and think that the N64 is Nintendo’s worst console by a country mile. For a long time, people thought I was a dunce for these opinions as well, but for whatever reason, time seems to have brought many over to my way of thinking. Apparently, the prequels are cool again, Space Jam is largely recognized to be an overwrought McDonald’s commercial, and people think N64 games look terrible! Welcome to my brain, everyone!\nAnd that’s exactly how I felt when I saw how much people hated the recently released GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition. “Hey, this game looks like crap…” Yeah, they always have! “These missions are repetitive and dull…” Yes! Always has been again! “The rain in this game looks like bukkake…”\nWell, that one’s new, but it’s definitely still on-brand.\n\nThese three remastered GTA games looked like cheap cash grabs, unloved and uncared about. That felt honest to me. A series about stealing stuff for easy money was trying to get away with a criminally shitty “definitive” version of their “classic titles”. Even better, they were so broken that they finally felt like video games again. Human faces suddenly appear in walls, cars grow to massive sizes for no reason, and people trash-talk before blasting off into space. Purely by accident, GTA had finally gotten weird and silly, and had become a worthwhile self-parody in the process. I was ready to buy the physical Switch port (the most broken version) on day one, just for laughs.\nThen it was delayed indefinitely, as the publisher was surely aghast at these games finally getting the low review scores they always deserved. It’s a bummer that, after GTA finally went to being “so bad it’s good” from “so bad it’s boring” that Rockstar is undoubtedly trying to make them blander again. But who knows, maybe they will go full Cruelty Squad with the Switch port when it’s finally sold on the cartridge. One can hope.\n\nMy favorite small game of the year: Mon Amour\nAt the same time, I was feeling alone with my dislike of the GTA games on the PS2, I was falling in love with another open-world game on the console: Chulip, the exploration and kissing game. It was everything that GTA wasn’t: cute, funny, kind, and quick to punish you for stepping out of line. And in this game, you’re in line for a smooch!\nOnce again, history has proven my weird taste in games to be the correct one. Chulip is now worth a bunch of money on the resale market, and people much smarter and more interesting than I talk about how great it is all the time. The creator of the game has taken notice as well. His latest game, Mon Amour, returns to Chulip‘s smooching concept but makes it a simple Flappy Bird-esque arcade game. That doesn’t sound that great, does it? But it is! The music, the graphics, the comedy, all top-notch, but my favorite thing about the game is the way if feels. In real life, it’s hard to know if you’re doing things right, and that goes double for moving in for your first kiss. Mon Amour replicates that feeling of “moving forward cautiously, following your instincts, but ready to fail at any moment” perfectly. Subjectively, it’s perfect.\n\nMy favorite medium-sized game of 2021: Axiom Verge 2\nAxiom Verge 2 is also about boldly moving into the unknown. At the start, it’s not a lot like the first game, eschewing old-school Metroid aesthetics for a more athletic, organic exercise. It’s about a new lead character doing new things in a new place, and while lore-hounds for the first game will find plenty of allusions to the original, this game definitely didn’t need to be called Axiom Verge 2. In fact, calling it that was a pretty big risk, at least from a marketing perspective. But the risk paid off, and in the end, it makes sense.\nJust as the original Axiom Verge was, intentionally or not, an accurate reflection of the one-person development team’s psyche, the sequel catches us up with where Tom Happ, the creator of the franchise, is in his life today. He’s a dad now, working to create both a good life for his kid with one hand and to make even better games than he has before with the other. The path to meet both goals is indelibly intertwined. He can’t make money for his family if he doesn’t make good games, and he can’t make good games unless he creates honest work that could only come from him.\nI was on the edge of my seat throughout the entirety of my playtime with Axiom Verge 2, waiting to see exactly if, and how, Tom would pull off this dual aim. In the end, he nailed it. My only complaint about the game is there isn’t more of it. When the credits finally rolled, I was not ready to quit. Then again, that’s true of just about every one of the games on this list. Thankfully, most of them are sure to get some sort of sequel and\/or DLC expansion at some point. They all did pretty well, so we probably won’t have to say goodbye to them anytime soon.\n\nMy favorite big game of 2021: No More Heroes 3\nI can’t believe this is goodbye! No More Heroes 3 has so many hints of where the series could go from here, from movie adaptations by Takashi Miike to Back to the Future-style forays into the far-flung foibles of Travis’s offspring. (SPOILERS) I mean, he cuts his brother in half, and like five minutes later, is decapitated by him! And we still don’t know exactly how why! This can’t be the end, can it?\nIt is.\nIn retrospect, you can tell Suda51 was planning to make this the last game in the series. Last episodes of TV shows often swing for the fences in the same way. For a series, all the episodes before the final one have a specific job to do; to get you to want to watch the next one. The last episode doesn’t have to pursue the audience in the same way. It exists in a time where there’s no tomorrow.\n\nFor Quantum Leap, that meant capping things off with a bunch of small talk among characters you’d never seen before. For Jim Henson’s Dinosaurs, it meant bringing a heavenly Apocolypse down to Earth. For No More Heroes 3, it meant all that and more. We’ve heard that even more magic was planned for the game, and fans will always wonder what could have been, but there is no doubting that this is the fullest, most fun entry in the series. Just as our old pal Jirard “The Completionist” Khalil. He put hundreds of hours into the game and is one of the few people in the world to truly see it all.\nSomeday, I might see it all too. No More Heroes 3 is a game I plan to play for the rest of my days. It’s broken in all the right ways while fixing all of the things that were less than perfect about its predecessors. More importantly, it loves No More Heroes, and its fans, with all its heart. In a year where it was easy to lose sight of what was good, games like this reminded me why I love the medium, and I’m grateful for it.\n\n \n\n\"Where do dreams end and reality begin?

Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.\n\nFor the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.\nNetflix to expand into cloud gaming, opens new studio in Southern California [TechCrunch]\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChris Moyse\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

While Raw Fury is keeping tight-lipped on the details, we do know that the premise of Kingdom Eighties concerns a rag-tag gang of kids and their efforts to save their neighborhood from the mysterious and titular “Greed.”\nThe new game will represent the fourth release in the franchise, following on from Kingdom (2015), Kingdom: New Lands (2016), and Kingdom: Two Crowns (2018). The new game will retain all of the resource-management, base-building, and combat of its predecessors, but is simply choosing to set the action in an entirely new world, one of arcade games, weekend adventures, and Denver the Last Dinosaur. Just remember to trade in your trusty steed for a BMX and you’ll be golden.\nKingdom Eighties is currently in development for PC and consoles. It is scheduled to launch in 2022.\n\n \n\nSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s. Former Saturday Night Slam Master. Graduated from Galaxy High with honors.

A fighting game lives and dies on the longevity of its community, so while these numbers are unlikely to be retained, MultiVersus will be looking to hook in enough regulars to keep the fists and fur flying over the coming weeks, months, and perhaps years — though Player First Games’ implementation of crossplay will certainly aid this goal.\nIf you want to check out the slapstick silliness for yourself, then the MultiVersus beta is available on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms right now. All you need do is download the game client on your platform of choice, sign in with a WB Games account, and you’re ready to rock. The “full” version of MultiVersus will launch later in 2022.\n\n \n\nSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s. Former Saturday Night Slam Master.

It’s a strange gem, one that sticks with you. -Jordan]<br \/><\/sub><\/p>\n<p>I recently replayed <em>Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest<\/em> for the first time in years. Coming into it a little older and a lot more pretentious, I was struck by what a special kind of game it is. It is a failure, yes. There have been plenty of those since 1987. But it is a failure that had stood the test of time. One that has earned love and a place in history largely on the merits of its failings. This honestly hits me at a personal level. I can only <em>dream<\/em> of one day becoming an interesting failure.<\/p>\n<p><em>Simon’s Quest <\/em>falls between the original <em>Castlevania <\/em>and <em>Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse<\/em>. It represents a wild detour in the progression between those two games. It moved the focus away from a traditional action-platforming style and onto adventure elements, with progress being gated more by exploration and puzzles than by challenge. There’s a day\/night cycle, and rudimentary experience and inventory systems. Grinding for currency is a relevant part of the game, but getting knocked into pits by medusa heads is not. Any player with the knowledge of how to do so can stomp Dracula to pieces in a few seconds. The knowledge of how to get that far in the first place is the hard part. And so on.<\/p>\n<p>In short, it’s a complete reversal of the things that make its immediate neighbours tick. That’s pretty interesting! Not many sequels are so bold, nor have their boldness so immediately undone. The trouble is that none of it actually works very well.

                "textplain": "\nPromoted from our Community Blogs\n[Destructoid user Moths is here to suggest that the world could use more games like Simon’s Quest, and for as bewildering as it can be even with a well-laid-out walkthrough, I can’t say I disagree. It’s a strange gem, one that sticks with you. -Jordan]\nI recently replayed Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest for the first time in years. Coming into it a little older and a lot more pretentious, I was struck by what a special kind of game it is. It is a failure, yes. There have been plenty of those since 1987. But it is a failure that had stood the test of time. One that has earned love and a place in history largely on the merits of its failings. This honestly hits me at a personal level. I can only dream of one day becoming an interesting failure.\nSimon’s Quest falls between the original Castlevania and Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse. It represents a wild detour in the progression between those two games. It moved the focus away from a traditional action-platforming style and onto adventure elements, with progress being gated more by exploration and puzzles than by challenge. There’s a day\/night cycle, and rudimentary experience and inventory systems. Grinding for currency is a relevant part of the game, but getting knocked into pits by medusa heads is not. Any player with the knowledge of how to do so can stomp Dracula to pieces in a few seconds. The knowledge of how to get that far in the first place is the hard part. And so on.\nIn short, it’s a complete reversal of the things that make its immediate neighbours tick. That’s pretty interesting! Not many sequels are so bold, nor have their boldness so immediately undone. The trouble is that none of it actually works very well. The developers were attempting to coax the NES, the Castlevania framework, and themselves into doing things that they just couldn’t quite do. To put it more bluntly, it is frequently laborious, runs poorly, and makes no sense.\n\nThe result is a sort of surreal anti-game, half-dressed in the trappings of a traditional classic.\nNone of the normal rules seem to apply. Boss fights present no challenge, and death means nothing. Dungeons contain huge dead ends – actual dead ends, the kind that there is no reason to visit and that you almost never see in games.

                "textplain": "\nWorld of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King Classic launches globally today and Destructoid sister site Icy Veins is here to tell you all about it, including an assortment of guides.\nGlobal Release Times\nWrath Classic launches in the Americas, Europe, Taiwan, Korea, and Australia\/New Zealand simultaneously. Check the details below for the exact time you can log in to the game and explore all that the new expansion has to offer.\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nNew Continent: Northrend – Heroes will begin their journey in one of two zones in Northrend — Borean Tundra or Howling Fjord. A vast new continent awaits!\nNew Hero Class: Death Knights – Available to both factions at Level 55, Death Knights harness the powers of darkness to help combat the evil that threatens Azeroth. In Wrath Classic, Blizard is bypassing the requirement for a player’s first Death Knight character, unless they decide to pick a fresh realm.\nNew Profession: Inscription – Scribe mystical glyphs that modify the properties of spells and abilities or create powerful trinkets and off-hand items.\nAchievements – Show off your accomplishments and earn various rewards in WoW Classic!\nDungeons &amp; Raids – Multiple new dungeons and 3 raids will be available during Phase 1.\n\nWrath of the Lich King Classic is included with existing World of Warcraft subscriptions. If you subscribe to World of Warcraft, you can also play Wrath of the Lich King Classic at no additional cost.\n\nNew Hero Class: Death Knight\nDeath Knights are a new Hero Class available in Wrath Classic. They start at Level 55 in Ebon Hold and have 3 specializations to choose from: Blood, Frost, and Unholy. You do not need an existing Level 55 character on the same realm to create your first Death Knight in Wrath Classic. Fresh start realms are an exception to the rule. Any Death Knight created after your first one must be on a different realm, and requires an existing Level 55 character on the same realm. Completing the Death Knight intro in Wrath Classic rewards the Frostbrood Proto-Wyrm mount on live servers.\nIf you’re playing a Death Knight in Wrath Classic, we have a set of guides specifically tailored to help you with leveling, gearing, talents, addons, and macros.\nDeath Knight PvE &amp; PvP Guides\nDeath Knight Gear Guides\nTalent Guides\nInscription is a new Profession that lets you craft powerful items called glyphs that enhance spells and abilities. Scribes can create various trinkets and off-hand items.\n\n\nWe’ve all been there! It is always difficult to choose a class, especially in an MMORPG like World of Warcraft, and when you finally decide which class to play, it’s time to start leveling! The cap has been raised to Level 80 in Wrath Classic (up from Level 70 in Burning Crusade Classic).\nIf you do not plan on maining a Death Knight, we have leveling guides for other classes as well with recommended builds and talents.\nDruid Leveling Guides\n\nDruid Leveling Guide\nBalance Druid Leveling Guide\nFeral DPS Druid Leveling Guide\nFeral Tank Druid Leveling Guide\nRestoration Druid Leveling Guide\n\nHunter Leveling Guides\n\nHunter Leveling Guide\nBeast Mastery Hunter Leveling Guide\nMarksmanship Hunter Leveling Guide\nSurvival Hunter Leveling Guide\n\nMage Leveling Guides\n\nMage Leveling Guide\nArcane Mage Leveling Guide\nFire Mage Leveling Guide\nFrost Mage ST Leveling Guide\nFrost Mage AoE Leveling Guide\n\n\nPaladin Leveling Guides\n\nPaladin Leveling Guide\nHoly Paladin Leveling Guide\nProtection Paladin Leveling Guide\nRetribution Paladin Leveling Guide\n\nPriest Leveling Guides\n\nPriest Leveling Guide\nDiscipline Priest Leveling Guide\nHoly Priest Leveling Guide\nShadow Priest Leveling Guide\n\nRogue Leveling Guides\n\nRogue Leveling Guide\nAssassination Rogue Leveling Guide\nCombat Rogue Leveling Guide\nSubtlety Rogue Leveling Guide\n\nShaman Leveling Guides\n\nShaman Leveling Guide\nElemental Shaman Leveling Guide\nEnhancement Shaman Leveling Guide\nRestoration Shaman Leveling Guide\n\nWarlock Leveling Guides\nAs of the time of writing this article, Warlock guides are in the process of being deployed on the site.

                "textplain": "\n\n\n \n\nThe Cloud, too\nA Trackmania console release is slated for “early 2023,” according to an announcement made in an Ubisoft Forward stream today.\nThe window given right now is “early 2023,” and PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Stadia, and Luna were specifically mentioned in the reveal (as were “cloud platforms”). Cross-play and cross-progression are confirmed ahead of time too, which is a nice surprise that doesn’t require us to dig into a hidden FAQ to figure out if that’s actually planned or not.\nIn case you forgot, Trackmania is the shortened title for the 2020 rendition of the series, which launched as a free-to-play game. As of today, a yearly “club level” subscription costs $29.99, which has still earned the ire of many prospective players. As Ubisoft puts it, you can: “Enhance your experience with Standard Access and unleash your creativity. Play solo or multiplayer on seasonal campaigns and keep track of your progression with medal collection, trophies, and regional and worldwide rankings.”\nThe combination of only being available on PC and the subscription model has squarely put Trackmania 2020 in the “maybe” column since launch. At this point, quickly being able to boot it up on a console could sway me to give it another shot.\n\n\n \n\nReviews Director, Co-EIC - Chris has been enjoying Destructoid avidly since 2008. He finally decided to take the next step, make an account, and start blogging in January of 2009.

Tackle brain-teasing conundrums that will require patience under pressure, lateral thinking, an eye for detail, and a nose for exploration.\nCoin Crew has itself designed multiple real-life Escape Room scenarios, so fans can expect an authentic experience. Much like their IRL counterparts, Escape Academy will have a running narrative concerning a team of escapists in training, who find themselves in a high-stakes situation way beyond their initial expectations.\nEscape Academy will launch in June on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. It will also be made available on Xbox Game Pass on launch day.\n\n \n\nSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s. Former Saturday Night Slam Master.

The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.\nThe new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.\n\nIn addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service.

After the announcement, Destructoid took some time to talk to some of the designers behind bringing the strategy series into space.<\/p>\n<p>Lead Designers David McDonough and Will Miller were present for the interview along with Systems Gameplay Designer Anton Strenger. The designers discussed the inspiration behind <em>Beyond Earth<\/em>, some of the world building systems, and the possibility for crossover with other Firaxis science fiction properties. Read it below!<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/v1cdn.destructoid.com\/CivBE1-620x.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Destructoid<\/strong>: Anything you want to say about <em>Civilization: Beyond Earth<\/em> right off the bat?<br \/><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Miller<\/strong>: We’ve been working on this game for a while, and to announce it today in front of some of our biggest fans is just the coolest thing. It’s a really fun game. You know, it’s <em>Civilization<\/em> in space! Our fans have been wanting this for a long time, and this is it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Destructoid<\/strong>: What sort of challenges are there converting <em>Civilization<\/em> to sci-fi?<br \/><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>McDonough<\/strong>: There are lots. It’s really exciting. <em>Civ<\/em> is a game with a great legacy, but it’s almost all historically based. Among that legacy are <em>Alpha Centauri<\/em> and <em>XCOM<\/em>. This game is inspired by all of those.  The things that make <em>Civ<\/em> fun, when you play <em>Civ<\/em> you always want to go “one more turn,” but the world around it is already set. Without history we have to make up technology trees, alien worlds, and that has been one of the bigger challenges.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Destructoid<\/strong>: We were curious about how you would handle technology in <em>Beyond Earth<\/em>. How much is based off of what scientists are saying may be possible and how much is more like “hey this would be really cool if we did this”?<\/p>\n<p><strong>McDonough<\/strong>: It’s both! We did a lot of research on modern day scientific thinking and we thought it was important that our game start in reality, in a plausible setting. For the rest, we were inspired by a lot of current science fiction. But the best sci-fi is also scientifically real, so hopefully we have the best of both.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qtYWqE55s24\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><strong>Destructoid<\/strong>: Take me through the timeline. Where does this start? Is it present day onward?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Miller<\/strong>: It’s 200 to 250 years after present day. So we’re imagining an earth in the future, and things good and bad have happened, and it culminates in an event where nations around the world are sending out expeditions into space to different planets to colonize, to spread the roots of humanity beyond our planet. So, like David said, we start in a very familiar place based on actual science, and we want to be able to draw a clear line from science that we know today and space travel we know today. We’re very inspired by things like SpaceX and the new <em>Cosmos<\/em> with Neil deGrasse Tyson, we just love all that stuff. So we’re taking all of the inspiration from that and keeping it very plausible, and starting from a new place 200 years from now and kind of just going wild.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Destructoid<\/strong>: You said you’ve been working on this for a long time. Exactly how long have you been working on this?<\/p>\n<p><strong>McDonough<\/strong>: Unfortunately we can’t say specifically, but I think Will and I have been designing it in our heads for a really long time. Whispering in some ears around Firaxis.<br \/><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Miller<\/strong>: That’s kind of how games get made around Firaxis. <em>XCOM<\/em> was Jake Solomon’s baby for a long time, and he whispered in the right ears, and it eventually became a great game. We were given our shot at this, and it was the right time. We had a team that really wanted to do it, and it fit in our schedule, and we’re so fortunate to be able to make this game.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Destructoid<\/strong>: Did it start out as “Hey, wouldn’t it be rad if we made <em>Alpha Centauri<\/em>?” and went from there to “Well, we can’t really, but let’s do basically that”?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Miller<\/strong>: It’s always been a reality to us that that IP is just sort of off limits, and I don’t know if we would have used it if we had it, honestly. This game is such a different thing. It’s definitely inspired by <em>Alpha Centauri<\/em>, but it’s also inspired by a lot of other things too. It’s a very different game and it has very different characteristics. It feels a lot different. I think it started as “Would it be cool if we could take <em>Civilization<\/em> into space? What would that game look like?” and then we went from there.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/v1cdn.destructoid.com\/CivBE2-620x.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Destructoid<\/strong>: Is there any chance for any sort of crossover with <em>XCOM<\/em>?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Miller<\/strong>: The two games exist in their own fictional universes. That gives us the most flexibility, but I think you could expect some nods and winks and homages between the two.<\/p>\n<p><strong>McDonough<\/strong>: One of the things about sci-fi is you can make easter eggs with no problem.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Destructoid<\/strong>: So you’re going off and exploring alien worlds. What’s the variety going to be like for that?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Strenger<\/strong>: We spent a lot of time making the map so that it isn’t just like, earth and then purple earth. So everything in the map generator like landmass features to other crazy things to the alien life that is populating that map can change. We have a lot of different biomes, like an arid biome or a wetter jungle one. So the combinations really make it so every time you play, it’s a unique world with its own challenges.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Destructoid<\/strong>: You guys seem pretty excited for this.<\/p>\n<p><strong>McDonough<\/strong>: The panel today was unbelievably cool, to see the reactions from the fans.

                "textplain": "\nPossible crossover with XCOM, inspiration sources, and more\nLast weekend during its panel at PAX East, Firaxis announced the next big project for the Civilization franchise: Civilization: Beyond Earth. After the announcement, Destructoid took some time to talk to some of the designers behind bringing the strategy series into space.\nLead Designers David McDonough and Will Miller were present for the interview along with Systems Gameplay Designer Anton Strenger. The designers discussed the inspiration behind Beyond Earth, some of the world building systems, and the possibility for crossover with other Firaxis science fiction properties. Read it below!\n\nDestructoid: Anything you want to say about Civilization: Beyond Earth right off the bat?\nMiller: We’ve been working on this game for a while, and to announce it today in front of some of our biggest fans is just the coolest thing. It’s a really fun game. You know, it’s Civilization in space! Our fans have been wanting this for a long time, and this is it.\nDestructoid: What sort of challenges are there converting Civilization to sci-fi?\nMcDonough: There are lots. It’s really exciting. Civ is a game with a great legacy, but it’s almost all historically based. Among that legacy are Alpha Centauri and XCOM. This game is inspired by all of those.  The things that make Civ fun, when you play Civ you always want to go “one more turn,” but the world around it is already set. Without history we have to make up technology trees, alien worlds, and that has been one of the bigger challenges.\nDestructoid: We were curious about how you would handle technology in Beyond Earth. How much is based off of what scientists are saying may be possible and how much is more like “hey this would be really cool if we did this”?\nMcDonough: It’s both! We did a lot of research on modern day scientific thinking and we thought it was important that our game start in reality, in a plausible setting. For the rest, we were inspired by a lot of current science fiction. But the best sci-fi is also scientifically real, so hopefully we have the best of both.\n\nDestructoid: Take me through the timeline. Where does this start? Is it present day onward?\nMiller: It’s 200 to 250 years after present day. So we’re imagining an earth in the future, and things good and bad have happened, and it culminates in an event where nations around the world are sending out expeditions into space to different planets to colonize, to spread the roots of humanity beyond our planet. So, like David said, we start in a very familiar place based on actual science, and we want to be able to draw a clear line from science that we know today and space travel we know today. We’re very inspired by things like SpaceX and the new Cosmos with Neil deGrasse Tyson, we just love all that stuff. So we’re taking all of the inspiration from that and keeping it very plausible, and starting from a new place 200 years from now and kind of just going wild.\nDestructoid: You said you’ve been working on this for a long time. Exactly how long have you been working on this?\nMcDonough: Unfortunately we can’t say specifically, but I think Will and I have been designing it in our heads for a really long time. Whispering in some ears around Firaxis.\nMiller: That’s kind of how games get made around Firaxis. XCOM was Jake Solomon’s baby for a long time, and he whispered in the right ears, and it eventually became a great game. We were given our shot at this, and it was the right time. We had a team that really wanted to do it, and it fit in our schedule, and we’re so fortunate to be able to make this game.\nDestructoid: Did it start out as “Hey, wouldn’t it be rad if we made Alpha Centauri?” and went from there to “Well, we can’t really, but let’s do basically that”?\nMiller: It’s always been a reality to us that that IP is just sort of off limits, and I don’t know if we would have used it if we had it, honestly. This game is such a different thing. It’s definitely inspired by Alpha Centauri, but it’s also inspired by a lot of other things too. It’s a very different game and it has very different characteristics. It feels a lot different. I think it started as “Would it be cool if we could take Civilization into space? What would that game look like?” and then we went from there.\n\nDestructoid: Is there any chance for any sort of crossover with XCOM?\nMiller: The two games exist in their own fictional universes. That gives us the most flexibility, but I think you could expect some nods and winks and homages between the two.\nMcDonough: One of the things about sci-fi is you can make easter eggs with no problem.\nDestructoid: So you’re going off and exploring alien worlds. What’s the variety going to be like for that?\nStrenger: We spent a lot of time making the map so that it isn’t just like, earth and then purple earth. So everything in the map generator like landmass features to other crazy things to the alien life that is populating that map can change. We have a lot of different biomes, like an arid biome or a wetter jungle one. So the combinations really make it so every time you play, it’s a unique world with its own challenges.\nDestructoid: You guys seem pretty excited for this.\nMcDonough: The panel today was unbelievably cool, to see the reactions from the fans. We’ve been waiting a long time to be able to show it. We’ve been waiting a long time to come back to Civilization in the future.\nMiller: This game really is for our fans. For so long, our fans have been asking for a remake of Alpha Centauri or Civ in space or whatever, and this really is our game for them.\n\n \n\nDarren is a scientist during the day.

Interactive Entertainment. Pop culture has beaten me into submission when it comes to complaining about this kind of misuse of adored IPs. It’s honestly a losing battle to try and fight it, so I choose to just go with the flow. If Warner Bros. is cool having a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/multiversus-director-says-the-iron-giant-fighting-because-alternate-universe\/\" target=\"_blank\">weapon of mass destruction that famously doesn’t want to fight<\/a> beating the snot out of a child, then I say why not.

If you’re coming into this straight from <em>Smash<\/em> or <em>Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl<\/em>, a lot of what you’ll experience here will be familiar. You’re still trying to do enough damage to an opponent until you’re able to knock them out of the stage.<\/p>\n<p>But don’t think you can get by ignoring the tutorial information. While this is a platform fighter with similar attack inputs (directional basic attacks and directional special attacks) it’s a pretty different beast of a game with its own systems and unique stylings. For starters, the game is very upfront about attack fatigue. Spamming the same move weakens it, forcing players to use their entire arsenal if they want to continue doing serious damage. The game also doesn’t have a block button. You can dodge, and it is a <em>vital<\/em> tool in any match you’ll play, but that’s tied to a dodge meter that’ll dwindle if you use it too much. Most characters have one or more moves that have a cooldown timer tied to them as well. In the air, all characters have two jumps, two air dodges, and two special attacks they can use without touching the ground. All characters also have the ability to wall jump, which makes getting back onto the stage pretty damn easy. With all of those changes and more to the familiar formula, most players will probably have to approach <em>MultiVersus<\/em> differently from other fighters in the genre.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you’re already an expert airborne fighter. If that’s the case, you’ll fit right in here.<\/p>\n<p>I am not somebody who enjoys fighting in the air with platform fighters. I’m very much a keep-my-feet-on-the-ground type of brawler. However, that’s really not an option with a lot of the available characters here. A few, like Superman and Taz, have powerful enough attacks that you can knock out an opponent from the ground. But most of the fighters here feel pretty damn weak, and if you want to effectively eliminate your foes, you’re going to want to follow them into the air after you’ve knocked them sky high to finish the job. For me, that has taken some getting used to, as has the floaty nature of jumping in this game, but I’m excited to use the skills I’ve been developing here in the other platform fighters I play.<\/p>\n<p>While you can play in 1v1 and free-for-all modes, as well as against bots, the core <em>MultiVersus<\/em> experience is its 2v2 team battles. As you go through the training, you’ll get a sneak peek of how certain characters in the game are designed around team gameplay. And, like support characters in <em>Overwatch<\/em>, getting good with one of these fighters will make you indispensable when playing with friends and strangers online. For this closed alpha, the online connection has been rock-solid, above and beyond anything Nintendo has ever achieved with its flagship fighter.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/180eea02e3280-B5Reqffj7dTqCOzQBCupuEMP-scaled.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"MultiVersus beta impressions\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Choose your fighter carefully<\/h2>\n<p>In regards to the playable characters for the <em>MultiVersus<\/em> alpha, there are 15 at your disposal. Outside of Iron Giant, everyone who’s been announced so far is in. That means Shaggy and Velma from <em>Scooby-Doo<\/em>, Finn and Jake from <em>Adventure Time,<\/em> Steven and Garnet from <em>Steven Universe<\/em>, a handful of superheroes, cartoon characters, and a girl who has no name. There’s also future-must-have-plush-toy Reindog, a four-legged beast who is a godsend in team battles if the player using them knows how to effectively utilize their entire skillset. Not every fighter is available right away. For whatever reason, several, including Arya Stark, Batman, and Garnet, are locked away until you can earn enough coins to purchase them. I understand that being the case when the game actually launches, but why are you making me work during a closed alpha?<\/p>\n<p>If you want to test any of these characters out, you can do that in the training mode. Not only will this let you try before you buy, but it’ll also help you adapt to the wildly varied playstyles of each fighter.<\/p>\n<p>I have to give Player First Games credit. I think the core cast of <em>MultiVersus<\/em> is the most eclectic group of fighters in the genre, both in terms of where they’re pulled from and how their unique attributes create a playstyle that is distinct from every other fighter. For a cast of characters controlled with the same general inputs, there is very little similarity between them. They’re also creative in a way that really taps into who they are as a character and how their identity is reflected in their play style. Take Velma, for instance. This “experimental” support character — all characters here have classes like support, mage, tank, bruiser, etc. — is designed around the concept of solving mysteries. As she fights, clues will drop out of her opponents. If she picks up enough of these clues, she can “solve the mystery,” which in this case, means sending in a cop car to nab a competitor. If you play this move right, you can trap your opponent over a pit for an easy elimination.<\/p>\n<p>That is the type of creativity that permeates many of the characters here. Some are pretty basic. I don’t think too many people are going to be wowed by the likes of Superman or Batman, even though they’re both efficient fighters. But when you look at Tom &amp; Jerry, who are brilliantly animated in a way that all of Tom’s attacks are just him taking swipes at Jerry, it’s hard not to be awestruck by what the developers managed to do here. By the way, if you’re decent with Rosalina in <em>Smash<\/em>, you’ll want to gravitate toward Tom &amp; Jerry right away.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/180ee9ff01376-G1ekuDQPqJAhM1OVqboa95Vm.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"MultiVersus\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Looking toward the future<\/h2>\n<p>If this does manage to take off, the sky’s the limit for potential characters.

It’s probably why the game has been circulating so fast through videos.

                "textplain": "\nSlip and slide all the way around the song\nYou’ve probably noticed Trombone Champ popping up all over your social media feeds over the last couple days or so. It is instantly recognizable as exactly what it is: a rhythm game about playing the trombone. The simplicity belies the point, though. Trombone Champ is a trombone rhythm game, and an exceedingly good one too.\nAt this point, I’d go into some sort of recitation of how Trombone Champ sets this all up. Maybe how it handles, or what buttons it uses to do the things it does. The mouse moves a cursor up and down in inverted fashion, and your mouse click or any keyboard button is held to play notes.\nYet much like Untitled Goose Game or Snipperclips, this is the sort of experience you can just “get” by looking at it. It’s probably why the game has been circulating so fast through videos. I first saw this game on Giant Bomb’s Unprofessional Fridays segment, and again when PC Gamer’s lovely rendition of Beethoven’s Fifth hit Twitter.\n\nThe world's first trombone rhythm game is instantly a GOTY contender. And no, I'm not kidding. Turn up the volume and hear Beethoven like you've never heard it before. https:\/\/t.co\/Qu7Cmkhjzc pic.twitter.com\/jTXNdWx3Zm\n— PC Gamer (@pcgamer) September 20, 2022\nBooting it up myself, I was also amazed at how quick it all felt natural.

                "textplain": "\n\n\n \n\nTurn out the lights\nA remake of Resident Evil 4 has been going around the rumor mill for a little while now. And according to a new report, it’ll be taking a little bit of a different tone.\nFanbyte has some new details on the reported remake, and how it will make some changes to the GameCube-era classic Resident Evil 4. According to their sources, Capcom wants to adjust the tone of the game, making it spookier. It’s not a “scene-for-scene” recreation, but taking some inspiration from the concepts in old RE4 demos and preview reels left on the cutting room floor.\nOther side characters are reportedly set to have some more screen time and larger roles, and other aspects like Assignment: Ada and Separate Ways will get fleshed out. Earlier leaks about a Wesker redesign are, according to Fanbyte’s sources, not accurate; those are from a different, apparently canceled, Resident Evil project at Capcom.\nThe report does indicate that Capcom is hoping to announce the remake early this year, though that timeframe could shift.\n\nThe story changes line up with a recent statement from Resident Evil 4 director Shinji Mikami, where he said that if a remake did happen, it would be great if Capcom could “make the story better.” One aspect Fanbyte’s report highlights is potentially setting the village, and other sections, at night. That would certainly ramp up the horror aspect. The report indicates that Capcom approached Mikami and he was intrigued by the offer, but declined so he could stay at Tango Gameworks.\nWith the success of the previous Resident Evil remakes, it certainly seems like RE4 would happen. Nothing’s been formally announced yet, but with rumors swirling about it for years now, you’d hope it’s just a matter of time. Until then, there’s both a VR version and brand-new HD mod to tide us over.\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tCMA filings show how the Activision Blizzard deal could help build the Xbox mobile store\nAmid investigations over Microsoft’s possible acquisition of Activision Blizzard, new details have emerged about its plans for a mobile store to compete with other platforms.\nMicrosoft’s Activision Blizzard deal is under investigation by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). As part of those filings, Microsoft says a motivation for the acquisition is to help build out its mobile presence.\nHere’s the relevant item from the CMA filing, as reported on by The Verge:\n“The transaction will improve Microsoft’s ability to create a next generation game store which operates across a range of devices, including mobile as a result of the addition of Activision Blizzard’s content.

It’ll also be the debut of Push mode, six new maps, and more than 30 character skins, including a new Mythic tier of skins.<\/p>\n<p>The first example of a Mythic skin was a cool Cyber Demon skin for Genji with customization elements like tattoos, masks, and colors. I’m… intrigued! And also worried about how much Mythic skins will cost (whether that’s actual money or time invested).<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Overwatch-2-Cyberdemon-Mythic-Genji-skin.jpg?resize=640%2C345&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Cyber Demon Mythic Genji skin\" \/><figcaption><sub>Our first look at a customizable Mythic-tier skin for Genji.<\/sub><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Other new cosmetics, like banners and weapon charms, will help pad out the battle pass; one example was a little frosted donut keychain.

In other words, there’s cross-platform progression, which is definitely something they had to deliver. That said, the first <em>Overwatch 2<\/em> battle pass won’t be ready until Season 2 starts on December 6. After all this time, the launch — well, the “rollout,” really — sure seems gradual.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Overwatch-2-battle-pass.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Overwatch 2 battle pass\" \/><figcaption><sub>An early look at the Season 1 battle pass.<\/sub><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h2>Competitive<\/h2>\n<p>Starting with Season 1 on October 4, <em>Overwatch 2<\/em> will have “a reimagined competitive experience that was created to give players more tools to improve gameplay and feel a sense of progression in competitive play,” according to Blizzard. “Players will have more of an impact on individual matches with the shift to 5v5, and there will be additional systems in place to help you discern your contributions per match.”<\/p>\n<h2>Where’s PvE?<\/h2>\n<p>As for <em>Overwatch 2<\/em> PvE, we got a few gameplay glimpses of Null Sector’s return and some fairly open-ended developer quotes about the team’s ambitions.<\/p>\n<p>“With PvE, we have an opportunity to go a step further, to go deeper into diverse storytelling in ways that we really just haven’t been able to before,” said Keller. It’ll be delivered starting in 2023 “through the live service,” just like the PvP content.

                "textplain": "\nSeasonal updates every nine weeks\nDuring the Overwatch 2 Reveal Event this morning, Blizzard elaborated (somewhat!) on its free-to-play launch and what’s in the content pipeline for this live-service sequel.\nIf you’ve been waiting to hear more about PvE, welp, that wasn’t the focus of today’s stream — and the new story missions won’t be playable until 2023 — but we’ve got a roadmap for PvP and confirmation that loot boxes are out and a battle pass format is in.\nComing off of Overwatch 1, the team’s main goal is to try and deliver content on a “frequent and consistent basis,” according to game director Aaron Keller.\nCurrently, they’re committing to major updates every nine weeks, starting with the launch on October 4. “Players can expect to see a new hero every other season, with elements like new maps and game modes in the seasons between,” Blizzard said in a blog post.\nThe 2022 roadmap and a tease for 2023\nSeason 1 starts on October 4, followed by Season 2 on December 6.\nAs you can see from this roadmap, Season 1 of Overwatch 2 will be out on October 4 with three new heroes — Sojourn, Junker Queen, and a new support hero, who Blizzard teased with a snippet of footage featuring a spirit fox. It’ll also be the debut of Push mode, six new maps, and more than 30 character skins, including a new Mythic tier of skins.\nThe first example of a Mythic skin was a cool Cyber Demon skin for Genji with customization elements like tattoos, masks, and colors. I’m… intrigued! And also worried about how much Mythic skins will cost (whether that’s actual money or time invested).\nOur first look at a customizable Mythic-tier skin for Genji.\nOther new cosmetics, like banners and weapon charms, will help pad out the battle pass; one example was a little frosted donut keychain. There will be a shop with virtual currency.\nCross-progression\nCrucially, with all of this new Stuff for players to stockpile, Blizzard said that if you earn something on console, PC, or in Overwatch 1, you can use it in Overwatch 2. In other words, there’s cross-platform progression, which is definitely something they had to deliver. That said, the first Overwatch 2 battle pass won’t be ready until Season 2 starts on December 6. After all this time, the launch — well, the “rollout,” really — sure seems gradual.\nAn early look at the Season 1 battle pass.\nCompetitive\nStarting with Season 1 on October 4, Overwatch 2 will have “a reimagined competitive experience that was created to give players more tools to improve gameplay and feel a sense of progression in competitive play,” according to Blizzard. “Players will have more of an impact on individual matches with the shift to 5v5, and there will be additional systems in place to help you discern your contributions per match.”\nWhere’s PvE?\nAs for Overwatch 2 PvE, we got a few gameplay glimpses of Null Sector’s return and some fairly open-ended developer quotes about the team’s ambitions.\n“With PvE, we have an opportunity to go a step further, to go deeper into diverse storytelling in ways that we really just haven’t been able to before,” said Keller. It’ll be delivered starting in 2023 “through the live service,” just like the PvP content. The team plans to show off (more of) where the characters are from in these PvE “experiences.”\nBeta sign-ups\nA new map, Rio, and Junker Queen, will be playable in the Overwatch 2 closed beta starting on June 28. Beta sign-ups are now available for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.\nNotably, “Beta access does not roll over from the previous Overwatch 2 PvP Beta.”\n\n\n \n\nJordan is a founding member of Destructoid and poster of seemingly random pictures. They are anything but random.\n\n\n\n",

                "textplain": "\n\n\n \n\nStardew Valley‘s grandpa has seen better days\nYou’d think that so long after its release (now six years, to be exact), the Stardew Valley subreddit would have settled down by now, but in fact, it has done the opposite. While most of the posts usually consist of players posting bugs or how they’ve decorated their farms, a series of new memes have surfaced, which in turn has spawned a series of mods. The best part is that the joke isn’t even about anything in the actual core game itself, but instead in the introduction cutscene that plays when a player boots up a new save file. That’s right — it’s a bunch of grandpa mods.\nThe original scene starts with the player’s grandpa on his death bed (morbid, I know) as the game truly begins when the player inherits their grandfather’s farm and moves to Pelican Town. While the rest of the sequence shows the player character quitting their job and getting on the bus out to the country, it’s this first part that players have chosen to fixate on. You see, grandpa’s bed is looking a little rickety — kind of like the crappiest IKEA bed you can find, in fact, with just four skinny pieces of wood to hold it up. It looks like it’s ready to collapse at any second.\n I feel like I’ve helped kick off a dying grandpa renaissance and honestly I’m so thrilled from StardewValley \nPlayers thought this was pretty funny, and so they took the intro and ran with it by modding the opening scene of the game with their own interpretations.\nOne mod makes the already pretty crappy bed only slightly worse, while others depict the already-dead grandpa dead on the floor with flies buzzing around him. You can even mod him in the classic Family Guy death pose, if you so wish. The most recent installment makes it look like he’s wet the bed. Someone even went to the trouble of adding a NSFW, uh, happy version of grandpa’s death.\nThese mods are pretty silly, but I do have to admit that they play into the game’s tone in a fun way. Stardew Valley‘s opening with grandpa may make the game look all sweet and innocent from the start, but under the surface, it’s full of darker hidden content, like turning your unwanted children into doves, for example. I have to hand it to the Stardew Reddit community for their creativity, because these certainly made me chuckle.\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tRumble Roses\nSomething very special from the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster takes time out from its recent Namco obsession to deliver not only a Tecmo title, but a fun, silly, and particularly obscure one at that — Available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch its forgotten fighter Angel Eyes!\nReleased to Japanese arcades in 1996, Angel Eyes — or to give it its full title Tōkidenshō Angel Eyes — is a super cult 2D fighter that was renowned for sporting an All Anime Gal cast of scrappers.

The biggest issue here isn’t a shortage of execution, it’s a lack of ambition.\nYet, I still recommend New Ghostbusters II to any fan of the films. From the soundtrack to the core gameplay, there’s a lot of love in the final product. Considering some of the bombs that have been thrown to fans throughout the franchise’s entire lifespan, a competent game from the past is a breath of fresh air.\nI mentioned that there was another HAL Laboratories creation released around the same time, Ghostbusters II on the Game Boy. While a lot of the concepts cross over to the platform, it’s not the same game. It’s significantly scaled down. Maybe still worth a look, but not as impressive as its NES equivalent.\nFor other retro titles you may have missed, click right here!\n\n \n\nZoey is a gadabout gaming hobbyist.

                "content": "<div>\n<h2>This thing is so small and quiet you’d think it was a student at the Milford School<\/h2>\n<p>One thing I’ve noticed with the past few console launches, something that became quite evident the day I preordered my Xbox Series S, is that I no longer feel the excitement I once did when moving into a new generation. Even last week, when I managed to secure an all-digital PS5 just minutes after I swore to stop trying until next year, it didn’t push me to jump for joy. I used to jump for joy picking up a new console. I remember being quite giddy standing in line at Walmart to buy the GameCube on a cold November morning.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe it’s because the promise of better technology has lead to diminishing returns over the past two console generations. Maybe it’s because there are no launch titles for the Xbox Series of consoles or the PS5 that I “must play now.” Or maybe, it’s because gaming is so prolific now that it’s really all about the games rather than the hardware you choose to play them on.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever it is, I do miss the excitement that comes with anticipating a new console. But with my Xbox Series S, that feeling has been replaced by something that might be just as fulfilling: the satisfaction of knowing you bought quality hardware.  I love my Series S not because I managed to buy the “hot new thing” but because this console is built so goddamn good.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/v1cdn.destructoid.com\/SeriesSBoxsize-noscale.jpg?resize=640%2C258&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Xbox Series S\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And it’s so much smaller than I thought it would be. This little white box measures 10.8″ long, 5.9″ deep, and 2.5″ tall when positioned on its side. It weighs less than five pounds. You could fit two of these in an Xbox Series X with a few square inches to spare. My current entertainment center is not well suited for multiple systems, so having a Wii U, PS4 Slim, and Switch hooked up to it takes up a decent amount of usable space. Thankfully, the Series S is so small it sits comfortably next to my Wii U. And unlike my PS4 Slim, this thing is quiet.<\/p>\n<p>Setting this thing up took around five minutes going through the Xbox app on my phone. With everything synced up to my Xbox account, the console scanned my television and showed me which Series S options I can and cannot use. I know this is not a new technology, as some of my fellow writers were quick to explain to me in Slack, but it did teach me more about my television and how to access HDR content on my PS4. Getting 120 fps is out of the question as my TV doesn’t support it, but I can experience 4K on video playback and with any games that support it (and yes, some games support 4K on the Series S). <\/p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a console with power, you should probably know what the Series S is packing in its petite body. Here are some of the specs:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>CPU: 8x Cores at 3.6 GHz (Custom Zen 2 CPU)<\/li>\n<li>GPU: 4 TFLOPS, 20 CUs @1.565 GHz<\/li>\n<li>Memory: 10 GB GDDDR6<\/li>\n<li>Internal Storage: 512 GB (364 GB usable)<\/li>\n<li>Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby TrueHD with Atmos, DTS 5.1<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the past month, I’ve come to love just how fast the Xbox Series S gets me into my games. Quick Restart is an outstanding feature. For games that support it, it’ll get you back into the action in mere seconds rather than having to wait for a game to load. And it does this across multiple titles at once rather than just having a single game in a suspend state. The console itself is quick to start too. If you go the environmentally friendly route with the Energy-Saver mode, it’ll take about 22 seconds to start up. If you choose Instant-On, it’s around four seconds.<\/p>\n<p>I’m also really digging the redesigned controller. I’ve always preferred the layout of the Xbox controller over the PlayStation because I have good taste, but the changes here make it even better than before. Particularly, the directional pad has a nice “clicky” quality to it, and it’s a bit more comfortable to use than my Xbox One controller.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/v1cdn.destructoid.com\/GamePass.jpg?resize=640%2C338&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Game Pass\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As of the publishing of this article, I haven’t actually bought any games for the console.

Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.\n\nFor the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.\nNetflix to expand into cloud gaming, opens new studio in Southern California [TechCrunch]\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChris Moyse\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

It’s a pretty exciting time for <em>Matrix <\/em>fans, and doubly so for those who also played <em>The Matrix Online<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the trailer for <em>The Matrix Resurrections<\/em>, characters new and old appear as Keanu Reeves’ Neo contends with reality and the Matrix once more.

Well, if <em>The Matrix Online <\/em>is to be believed, it’s because he’s dead.<\/p>\n<p><em>The Matrix Online <\/em>launched in 2005, as an MMO set after the events of the original <em>The Matrix <\/em>trilogy. It was billed as a continuation of <em>The Matrix <\/em>storyline, and even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ign.com\/articles\/2005\/04\/11\/the-matrix-online-2\" target=\"_blank\">had the blessing of the Wachowskis<\/a> to carry on the story.<\/p>\n<p>One major storyline beat was Morpheus attempting to get Neo’s body back from the machines, following the events of <em>The Matrix Revolutions<\/em>. According to various accounts, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/jaowriter.net\/2016\/05\/18\/now-available-the-matrix-online-archives\/\" target=\"_blank\">fan-maintained archive<\/a> of <em>The Matrix Online<\/em>, Morpheus held public speeches calling for the return of Neo’s body. When this didn’t work, well, he took to more drastic measures. Namely, a sort of code bomb that would expose parts of the Matrix world to those still in it, “awakening” them.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screenshot-1474.jpg?resize=640%2C336\" alt \/><\/p>\n<p>This obviously caused a bit of a stir, and it soon came to a head.

                "textplain": "\nMorpheus’ conspicuous absence could be explained by an MMO from the ’00s\nThe trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, a new film in The Matrix universe, dropped this morning. It’s a pretty exciting time for Matrix fans, and doubly so for those who also played The Matrix Online.\nThroughout the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, characters new and old appear as Keanu Reeves’ Neo contends with reality and the Matrix once more. But although both Neo and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity appear, Laurence Fishburne’s Morpheus is nowhere to be seen.\n\nWhy is Morpheus absent? Well, if The Matrix Online is to be believed, it’s because he’s dead.\nThe Matrix Online launched in 2005, as an MMO set after the events of the original The Matrix trilogy. It was billed as a continuation of The Matrix storyline, and even had the blessing of the Wachowskis to carry on the story.\nOne major storyline beat was Morpheus attempting to get Neo’s body back from the machines, following the events of The Matrix Revolutions. According to various accounts, including a fan-maintained archive of The Matrix Online, Morpheus held public speeches calling for the return of Neo’s body. When this didn’t work, well, he took to more drastic measures. Namely, a sort of code bomb that would expose parts of the Matrix world to those still in it, “awakening” them.\n\nThis obviously caused a bit of a stir, and it soon came to a head. After Morpheus plants a code bomb in a water facility, a mysterious character named The Assassin shows up. At first, it seems like Morpheus has made it out alive; but then the Assassin seemingly slides out of a vent and shoots Morpheus, killing him.\nIt’s an amazingly 2005 cutscene that you definitely need to see. Here’s the cutscene, via YouTube:\n\nOf course, there are fan theories that this was all staged. Even at the time, The Matrix Online players weren’t totally convinced of Morpheus’ death. Players who could enter the Matrix freely (dubbed “redpills”) were supposed to have an Emergency Jack-Out option, the reasoning for why death in the Matrix no longer meant death in real-life. Supposedly, the Assassin’s bullets contained a “kill code” that bypassed this technology, made only for very specific and extreme circumstances.\nIt’s all wild, but also fascinating. An MMO from 2005 might have significantly affected the plot for a new movie, and now is its own form of canon. Players in the game even held a funeral for Morpheus. While it seems like the new Matrix movie is moving into new territory, it’s pretty fun to think that The Matrix Online played a part in setting the stage.\n[Lead image via The Matrix (1999), Warner Bros.\/Village Roadshow Pictures]\n",

Rad!<\/p>\n<p>Marian debuted in the original 1987 release of<em> Double Dragon<\/em> as a damsel-in-distress but has since taken to the streets to dish out her own dose of vigilante justice.

                "textplain": "\nDamsel causing Distress\nThe fine folk at WayForward have dropped an exciting new update for eager fans of River City Girls 2, revealing new characters who are getting set to join the upcoming sequel’s playable roster. The two streetwise sluggers confirmed ready to rumble are River City Ransom Underground‘s Provie and Double Dragon‘s Marian. Rad!\nMarian debuted in the original 1987 release of Double Dragon as a damsel-in-distress but has since taken to the streets to dish out her own dose of vigilante justice. Now sporting an amazing shock of white hair and some rock-hard abs, Marian appeared in the original River City Girls as a super-savvy shop owner — helping out Kyoko and Misako with stat-boosting supplies — but it looks like she’s getting antsy to start busting faces once again.\nCapoeira master Provie made her Kunio-kun debut in 2017’s River City Ransom Underground, kicking ass as a member of crime-fighting troupe “The Flock”. Sporting intimidating street style and armed with acrobatic-but-devasting martial arts abilities, Provie is getting set to hit the back alleys of River City once more, laying waste to any foolhardy adversaries with her very particular brand of “break” dancing.\nThese two new additions only serve to further hype RCG fans, (including yer boy Moyse), for the upcoming sequel. I cant wait to see both gals in action. River City Girls 2 is currently in development for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PC, and Nintendo Switch. It is expected to launch in 2022.

What makes <em>It Takes Two<\/em> so special is that it feels like a genuine adventure you’re sharing with another person, one you won’t soon forget. Admittedly, a lot of my co-op gaming time blurs together, but I could look at any screenshot plucked from <em>It Takes Two<\/em> and recall how we both felt in the moment.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/v1cdn.destructoid.com\/It-Takes-Two-dungeon-crawler-scene.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"It Takes Two has a sword and sorcery dungeon-crawler sequence.\" \/><sub>[Image credit: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=2452652593\">Tamaster<\/a>]<\/sub><\/p>\n<p>I admire what Hazelight is doing on a fundamental level.

I also found it tough to click with much of the story and dialogue. What makes It Takes Two so special is that it feels like a genuine adventure you’re sharing with another person, one you won’t soon forget. Admittedly, a lot of my co-op gaming time blurs together, but I could look at any screenshot plucked from It Takes Two and recall how we both felt in the moment.\n[Image credit: Tamaster]\nI admire what Hazelight is doing on a fundamental level. Not just in terms of creating substantial co-op exclusive games that speak to new and experienced players, but making them attainable with split-screen and online options, and offering a generous you-only-pay-once Friend’s Pass system.\nI recognize that the studio has a pretty sweet funding deal under the EA Originals label and not every team can risk making a game like this that requires two people when it’s already hard enough to convince one player to show interest — but I wish this style of co-op game was far more prevalent.\nAs I already alluded to, I’m going to continue playing and enjoying indie party games, whatever Nintendo cooks up, and the occasional Borderlands, maybe. There will always be stuff to do. At the same time, I can’t help but wonder what else is possible in this space. Imagine if more of our favorite games and genres were built exclusively for split-screen and\/or online teamwork. That’s where my mind goes.\nWhatever Hazelight works on next, I’m there on day one. See you in a few years?\n\n \n\nJordan is a founding member of Destructoid and poster of seemingly random pictures. They are anything but random.\n\n\n\n",

Junker Queen, however, brings a much-needed tank into the mix, and has an attitude to boot. Her aggressive style is going to be really appealing to a lot of players, and her commanding shout (which buffs nearby teammates) is a cool callback to barbarian\/warrior playstyles. Her voice actor is also on point and fits the character well.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LGgqyer-qr4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Kiriko is a pretty cool support character, focusing on talismans (which can heal) and kunai as her primary source of damage. The classic intuitive <em>Overwatch<\/em> design is still present, as she holds her talismans on the left side of the screen (left-click) and her kunai on the right (right-click). She also has a snap-use protection charm that can make a group of teammates invulnerable for a brief moment; and sports killer traversal skills with a teleport that goes directly to an ally, and wall-climbing capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Her ultimate is a bit like Hanzo’s Dragonstrike, but this time it’s a kitsune that grants beneficial effects for her team. She’s interesting because she can change a single push with a well-timed invulnerability charm and her ultimate. Plus, I love climbing around every level, including all the old ones, with her wall-crawling. For me, the gameplay mostly checks out. Now it’s time to venture into darker territory.<\/p>\n<p>The Season Pass reward track is actually much simpler than the confusing pre-launch info rollout made it seem. So presently, at least for the first season, there’s a single “battle pass” that has 80 tiers. Free players can get some rewards from it, and premium players will unlock things at every track. Purchasing levels (which some passes allow or disallow, depending on the company) is an option. Here is everything that comprises the first <em>Overwatch<\/em> 2 season pass free track:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Newest support hero, Kiriko (for new players who won’t have her already)<\/li>\n<li>2 Epic Skins<\/li>\n<li>1 Weapon Charm<\/li>\n<li>2 Souvenirs<\/li>\n<li>1 Highlight Intro<\/li>\n<li>14 additional items (emotes, victory poses, name cards, sprays, player icons, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Prestige Tier Titles (8 earnable titles available only after completing the entire pass)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And here’s what you get from the premium track:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Immediate access to Kiriko<\/li>\n<li>20% XP Battle Pass Boost<\/li>\n<li>1 Mythic Skin<\/li>\n<li>5 Legendary Skins and 1 Epic Skin<\/li>\n<li>3 Play of the Game Intros<\/li>\n<li>4 Weapon Charms<\/li>\n<li>3 Emotes<\/li>\n<li>3 Souvenirs<\/li>\n<li>6 Poses<\/li>\n<li>6 Name Cards<\/li>\n<li>30+ additional cosmetic rewards<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To buy into the premium pass each season, it’ll cost you 1000 Overwatch Coins, or $10. Characters, “if they are included in a season pass” (not all of them will have one, as the current plan is offering characters in Season 1, Season 2, Season 4, and Season 6), will be unlocked at level 55 on the free track [this season it’s linked to Kiriko], and are unlocked automatically after buying the premium track. There’s also a shop with a limited number of items that can be purchased directly for coins. Phew! That’s most of it. Annoyed yet?<\/p>\n<p>So there’s a lot of ways you can look at this. In short, it’s a lot like the<em> Fortnite<\/em> season pass system Epic created years ago, but worse. In <em>Fortnite<\/em>, players can earn premium currency directly from the pass itself, which will pay for the next pass. In <em>Overwatch 2<\/em>, you can earn coins elsewhere, but it’s expected that you’ll be able to pay for at least every other pass, roughly. For a free player, slowly clawing your way up the pass to level 55 to gain access to a new character is excruciating, even if Blizzard is locking them from ranked play for a token few weeks. For hardcore players, it seems like you’ll be dropping $10 a few times a year (with a nine-week cadence announced for seasons), which gives you instant hero access.<\/p>\n<p>Then there’s the other wrinkle of brand new players needing to essentially start over from square one: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/overwatch-2-new-players-unlock-original-roster-blizzard-news\/\">including the requirement of unlocking the full original core cast<\/a>.

In the past Blizzard may have tried to innovate in some way or mix things up, but now they are following other genre leaders. It’s already leading to some negative sentiments toward <em>Overwatch 2<\/em>, and we’ll be keeping an eye on it as each season progresses.

I’ve played all of the games, some of them multiple times, and I even worked at Naughty Dog for a hot minute there. When I heard there was going to be a movie based on the series, though, I was skeptical. Part of that is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@destructoid\/video\/7068083942594743558?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id7052788164067706373\" target=\"_blank\">usual skepticism<\/a> that comes along with video game movies, but then there’s also the fact that <i>Uncharted<\/i> are some of the most movie-like games out there. Why would they need to make them into actual movies? Certainly it’s because they have their own fresh take to put on it.<\/p>\n<p>That’s what I was thinking… at least until I saw who they cast as Nate and Sully. Look, I’m all for giving everyone a chance to prove themselves, but I was unsure of those choices from the get-go. Even if we were going for an aged-down origin story take, sure, that’s something I can get behind in theory.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-screen-02-ps4-us-09mar16.png?resize=640%2C360\" alt \/><figcaption><sub>[Image Source: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.playstation.com\/en-us\/games\/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end\/\">PlayStation<\/a>]<\/sub><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h3>Questionable casting<\/h3>\n<p>Honestly, the cast was one of the most egregious things about this movie. I think the issue was that everyone just made boring choices. They were saying the lines, but there was no flavor, you know what I mean? It wasn’t giving me anything, let alone getting close to capturing the essence of these characters, who are larger than life in the games.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, Tom Holland is an action hero type, but he’s lacking a certain maturity that’s innate to Nathan Drake. If he’s supposed to be younger, that’s fine, but he still didn’t have that charisma that we’re used to from Nate. There are moments in there where the writing is capturing Nate, for sure, but Tom’s delivery was a bit too flat for me to make it work. I’m sorry Tommy, I love you as Spider-Man, but this one’s a no from me.<\/p>\n<p>Sully was also lacking his usual charms. Mark Wahlberg is still the worst casting choice for reasons already stated, but he also just spoke in his normal Marky Mark voice. There was no zest, no flavor in his voice, which is a letdown from the booming presence that Sully’s gravelly voice has in the games. That’s not to say that Mark Wahlberg couldn’t have ever worked as Sully, but his white bread acting choices certainly didn’t help.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/YJtbJnpHbE9ZLwka8Jz9PW.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" alt=\"Chloe and Nathan in the Uncharted movie\" \/><figcaption><sub>[Image Source: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gamesradar.com\/uncharted-movie-easter-eggs-references-nolan-north-cameo-naughty-dog\/\">GamesRadar<\/a>]<\/sub><\/figcaption><\/figure><p>We do get to see a credits sequence where Sully gets a mustache, and I can’t for the life of me figure out why they didn’t give him one in the movie. It makes him look so much more like the character, and they even could have written a funny quip about why he chose to grow it. Seems like a real waste of an opportunity to me.<\/p>\n<p>Side note: seeing Sully’s arc reduced to “gold or friend” was honestly so laughable to me. He’s one of my favorite characters of the games — he obviously cares about the treasure, but he also has a heart of gold and we can really tell how much he cares for the people in his life. He is more than a greedy loner who just wants gold! Justice for Sully!<\/p>\n<p>Chloe wasn’t my favorite either. In the games, she’s so charismatic and mysterious. In this movie, well, she’s just as boring as everyone else. I also don’t understand why they changed her backstory when the one in the game is so much cooler.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@destructoid\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@destructoid\">@destructoid<\/a> \n<p>The Uncharted movie has us…skeptical. <a title=\"fyp\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/fyp\">#fyp<\/a> <a title=\"foryoupage\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/foryoupage\">#foryoupage<\/a> <a title=\"gaming\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/gaming\">#gaming<\/a> <a title=\"unchartedmovie\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/unchartedmovie\">#unchartedmovie<\/a> <a title=\"uncharted\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/uncharted\">#uncharted<\/a> <a title=\"videogames\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/videogames\">#videogames<\/a> <a title=\"gamingnews\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/gamingnews\">#gamingnews<\/a><\/p>\n<p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - Destructoid\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/music\/original-sound-7068083937389660934\">♬ original sound – Destructoid<\/a> <\/p><\/section>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3>What is Uncharted really about?

To me, <i>Uncharted<\/i> is just as much about people as it is about swashbuckling adventure. All anyone in this movie seems to talk about is how you can’t trust anyone because they’ll turn their back on you.<\/p>\n<p>Then they all betray each other and it’s like, yeah no shit, that’s all you’ve talked about. Why not show me how these characters come to trust each other and become real friends, but then when the betrayals happen they actually feel like they hold some weight? Not only does the constant (and I mean <i>constant<\/i>) contention make the twists visible from a mile away, but it also doesn’t evolve to reveal anything new to us about the characters, or help capture the spirit of “the real treasure is the friends we made along the way” vibe that <i>Uncharted<\/i> always nails.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/f8bMPLkgc9bvsGQRDpJsGU.jpg?resize=640%2C352\" alt=\"Tom Holland in the Uncharted movie\" \/><figcaption><sub>[Image Source: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gamesradar.com\/sony-quietly-reveals-the-very-first-uncharted-movie-footage\/\">GamesRadar<\/a>]<\/sub><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h3>Who is Nathan Drake?<\/h3>\n<p>Take Nate’s character, for example.

That’s why he and his brother hold so tightly to this idea of being descendants of Sir Francis Drake. It ties them to a family that has done great things, something they always wished they could have. Sic parvis magna, remember?<\/p>\n<p>This idea is core to Nate’s character — it’s why he’s so proficient in treasure hunting in the first place, having studied it his whole life. It’s why when the wonders that he finds are destroyed so that they will never be able to show anyone (and monetize off of it), he brushes it off, because he loves the thrill of finding it in the first place. It’s why he is always willing to chase what he’s after to the point that it might even hurt the people he loves, which was explored at length in the story of <i>Uncharted<\/i> 4.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Uncharted-4-Second-Feature.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" alt \/><figcaption><sub>[Image Source: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/thenerdstash.com\/uncharted-movie-will-film-soon-without-a-director\/\">The Nerd Stash<\/a>]<\/sub><\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Naughty Dog did a great job of fleshing out Nate’s character over the course of the game series to be more than just a bland treasure-hunting dude, and it’s what made the series shine brightest. That’s why I was so disappointed to see any similar characterization missing from the film, even in short. We get the setup that Nate and his brother think they’re Drakes, which explains their fascination with history, but that’s about all we get.<\/p>\n<p>It’s also missing the implication that this is entirely untrue, which is what gives that idea its depth in the first place. If these characters are willing to convince themselves of an untrue lineage to connect to a feeling of greatness and a family to be proud of, that tells us a lot about who they are and the choices they make. If it’s just another fact spit out at us, it’s just exposition and nothing more.<\/p>\n<p>Another small but incredibly important gripe I have is about the accents.

She’s played by Sophia Taylor Ali, an American actress, and while she looked a great deal like Chloe (or a younger version of her), I could not distinguish what kind of accent she was going for.

                "textplain": "\nThis post contains major spoilers for the Uncharted movie. If you still want to be surprised, come back to this one later!\nStrap in folks, this one’s a doozy\nI like to consider myself a pretty devout Uncharted fan. I’ve played all of the games, some of them multiple times, and I even worked at Naughty Dog for a hot minute there. When I heard there was going to be a movie based on the series, though, I was skeptical. Part of that is the usual skepticism that comes along with video game movies, but then there’s also the fact that Uncharted are some of the most movie-like games out there. Why would they need to make them into actual movies? Certainly it’s because they have their own fresh take to put on it.\nThat’s what I was thinking… at least until I saw who they cast as Nate and Sully. Look, I’m all for giving everyone a chance to prove themselves, but I was unsure of those choices from the get-go. Even if we were going for an aged-down origin story take, sure, that’s something I can get behind in theory.\n[Image Source: PlayStation]\nQuestionable casting\nHonestly, the cast was one of the most egregious things about this movie. I think the issue was that everyone just made boring choices. They were saying the lines, but there was no flavor, you know what I mean? It wasn’t giving me anything, let alone getting close to capturing the essence of these characters, who are larger than life in the games.\nSure, Tom Holland is an action hero type, but he’s lacking a certain maturity that’s innate to Nathan Drake. If he’s supposed to be younger, that’s fine, but he still didn’t have that charisma that we’re used to from Nate. There are moments in there where the writing is capturing Nate, for sure, but Tom’s delivery was a bit too flat for me to make it work. I’m sorry Tommy, I love you as Spider-Man, but this one’s a no from me.\nSully was also lacking his usual charms. Mark Wahlberg is still the worst casting choice for reasons already stated, but he also just spoke in his normal Marky Mark voice. There was no zest, no flavor in his voice, which is a letdown from the booming presence that Sully’s gravelly voice has in the games. That’s not to say that Mark Wahlberg couldn’t have ever worked as Sully, but his white bread acting choices certainly didn’t help.\n[Image Source: GamesRadar]We do get to see a credits sequence where Sully gets a mustache, and I can’t for the life of me figure out why they didn’t give him one in the movie. It makes him look so much more like the character, and they even could have written a funny quip about why he chose to grow it. Seems like a real waste of an opportunity to me.\nSide note: seeing Sully’s arc reduced to “gold or friend” was honestly so laughable to me. He’s one of my favorite characters of the games — he obviously cares about the treasure, but he also has a heart of gold and we can really tell how much he cares for the people in his life. He is more than a greedy loner who just wants gold! Justice for Sully!\nChloe wasn’t my favorite either. In the games, she’s so charismatic and mysterious. In this movie, well, she’s just as boring as everyone else. I also don’t understand why they changed her backstory when the one in the game is so much cooler.\n\n @destructoid \nThe Uncharted movie has us…skeptical. #fyp #foryoupage #gaming #unchartedmovie #uncharted #videogames #gamingnews\n ♬ original sound – Destructoid \n\nWhat is Uncharted really about? Friendship.\nThe single worst thing about the Uncharted movie to me, though, is that it misses the one quintessential piece of what makes Uncharted what it is — it’s not the treasure, but the camaraderie. To me, Uncharted is just as much about people as it is about swashbuckling adventure. All anyone in this movie seems to talk about is how you can’t trust anyone because they’ll turn their back on you.\nThen they all betray each other and it’s like, yeah no shit, that’s all you’ve talked about. Why not show me how these characters come to trust each other and become real friends, but then when the betrayals happen they actually feel like they hold some weight? Not only does the constant (and I mean constant) contention make the twists visible from a mile away, but it also doesn’t evolve to reveal anything new to us about the characters, or help capture the spirit of “the real treasure is the friends we made along the way” vibe that Uncharted always nails.\n[Image Source: GamesRadar]\nWho is Nathan Drake?\nTake Nate’s character, for example. Sure, he wants the treasure because he wants to be rich — who wouldn’t? But more than that, he grew up in a broken family, and more than anything, he wants to feel like he’s a part of something greater than himself. That’s why he and his brother hold so tightly to this idea of being descendants of Sir Francis Drake. It ties them to a family that has done great things, something they always wished they could have. Sic parvis magna, remember?\nThis idea is core to Nate’s character — it’s why he’s so proficient in treasure hunting in the first place, having studied it his whole life. It’s why when the wonders that he finds are destroyed so that they will never be able to show anyone (and monetize off of it), he brushes it off, because he loves the thrill of finding it in the first place. It’s why he is always willing to chase what he’s after to the point that it might even hurt the people he loves, which was explored at length in the story of Uncharted 4.\n[Image Source: The Nerd Stash]Naughty Dog did a great job of fleshing out Nate’s character over the course of the game series to be more than just a bland treasure-hunting dude, and it’s what made the series shine brightest. That’s why I was so disappointed to see any similar characterization missing from the film, even in short. We get the setup that Nate and his brother think they’re Drakes, which explains their fascination with history, but that’s about all we get.\nIt’s also missing the implication that this is entirely untrue, which is what gives that idea its depth in the first place. If these characters are willing to convince themselves of an untrue lineage to connect to a feeling of greatness and a family to be proud of, that tells us a lot about who they are and the choices they make. If it’s just another fact spit out at us, it’s just exposition and nothing more.\nAnother small but incredibly important gripe I have is about the accents. Sam’s Boston accent was nowhere to be found, and that’s a huge problem for me and my roommate. It’s fun, it’s kind of his thing, and not having it that was a huge bummer. Chloe’s accent was… not good at all. She’s played by Sophia Taylor Ali, an American actress, and while she looked a great deal like Chloe (or a younger version of her), I could not distinguish what kind of accent she was going for. It changed every other line, and there were times that I couldn’t even understand what she was saying.\nSome positives\nThe most enjoyable parts of the Uncharted movie for me were the action and puzzle sequences, for sure. There would be moments where they step away from the lousy character stuff and just focus on treasure hunting, and those were such a blast. I’m already a huge fan of this genre, so they already had me going in, but I have to admit that seeing the characters use artifacts to follow clues to solve puzzles felt more like the games than any other parts of the movie.\nWe get nods all the way through the film to iconic moments from the game, like the cargo plane set piece from Uncharted 3 that we saw in the trailers.

In a nutshell, the proposed plan would require all Tournament Organizers (TOs) to apply for an official license in order to run a local or national tournament on flagship fighter<em> Street Fighter V: Champion Edition.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>All TOs running <em>SFV<\/em> would be required to officially run the event under Capcom guidelines, with Capcom suggesting that securing an official registration will add several stages of legitimacy to the tournament, while offering a sense of “insurance” in regards to prize payouts and player behavior at the event itself. Capcom would also supply TOs with marketing assets with which to promote their event, with the TO having the prestige of hosting an “official” Capcom<em> Street Fighter<\/em> tournament.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As promised, I wrote an article explaining Capcom's new licensing structure, what its community event license entails, what its esports event license could mean, why it may be doing this, and what I think about it. Let me know if you have any questions!<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/RVf28XbdR3\">https:\/\/t.co\/RVf28XbdR3<\/a><\/p>\n<p>— Just UltraDavid (@ultradavid) <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ultradavid\/status\/1498517478837612545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 1, 2022<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>And in the blue corner<\/h2>\n<p>The FGC, however, does not see Capcom’s plans as being altogether wholesome. Already concerned with the opening “big brother” salvo of having a multi-million dollar company over one’s shoulder, the proposal also notes that all live streams, video, and photographs of any licensed events automatically become usable, royalty-free, by Capcom. Additionally, Capcom will have the right to limit prize pool amounts, will ban priced ticketing for spectators, ban the sale of official merchandise on-site, and could simply deny the event altogether if it does not fall within company guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>Essentially, the FGC sees the proposal as being less about player security\/safety, and instead believes that Capcom is simply trying to control the American competitive<em> Street Fighter<\/em> scene on all levels, from the smallest local gathering to larger, national tournaments.

                "textplain": "\nTaking the L\nCapcom has found itself in the bad books of the competitive fighting game community (FGC) after proposing an official “licensing” scheme that could potentially be applied to all Street Fighter V (and presumably Street Fighter 6) tournaments held anywhere on American soil, regardless of size.\nRound 1 kicked off on February 28, when Capcom outlined its plans for the “Street Fighter V Community License Agreement“. In a nutshell, the proposed plan would require all Tournament Organizers (TOs) to apply for an official license in order to run a local or national tournament on flagship fighter Street Fighter V: Champion Edition.\nAll TOs running SFV would be required to officially run the event under Capcom guidelines, with Capcom suggesting that securing an official registration will add several stages of legitimacy to the tournament, while offering a sense of “insurance” in regards to prize payouts and player behavior at the event itself. Capcom would also supply TOs with marketing assets with which to promote their event, with the TO having the prestige of hosting an “official” Capcom Street Fighter tournament.\n\nAs promised, I wrote an article explaining Capcom's new licensing structure, what its community event license entails, what its esports event license could mean, why it may be doing this, and what I think about it. Let me know if you have any questions!https:\/\/t.co\/RVf28XbdR3\n— Just UltraDavid (@ultradavid) March 1, 2022\nAnd in the blue corner\nThe FGC, however, does not see Capcom’s plans as being altogether wholesome. Already concerned with the opening “big brother” salvo of having a multi-million dollar company over one’s shoulder, the proposal also notes that all live streams, video, and photographs of any licensed events automatically become usable, royalty-free, by Capcom. Additionally, Capcom will have the right to limit prize pool amounts, will ban priced ticketing for spectators, ban the sale of official merchandise on-site, and could simply deny the event altogether if it does not fall within company guidelines.\nEssentially, the FGC sees the proposal as being less about player security\/safety, and instead believes that Capcom is simply trying to control the American competitive Street Fighter scene on all levels, from the smallest local gathering to larger, national tournaments. In response to the proposal, some TOs have already announced that they will simply no longer host SFV tournaments at their events, focusing on other fighting games instead. A later statement from Capcom has done little assuage concerns.\n\nThis rings a bell…\nIt should be noted that this all sounds incredibly familiar. Around the 2017 launch of Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite — a title which Capcom was convinced was going to be the biggest competitive fighter of all time — leaked plans for MvC:I events featured a similar version of this licensing concept, alongside numerous other big-money plans for the competitive scene. This would not come to pass, of course, as MvC:I  failed to hit as a major league fighter. It seems, however, that Capcom’s plans might now be dusted off for both the twilight year of Street Fighter V and — likely — the incoming Street Fighter 6.\nThe FGC competitive scene is far from perfect. I have personally experienced problems in regards to payouts, insults, and general poor tournament management. But I wholly understand the TOs concerns here. Aside from the ownership of assets and the dictatorial nature of rules and pricing, Fighting games have always been built on their communal “grassroots” mentality.

The designer’s last game was about strategically plummeting, and this new one, <em>Poinpy<\/em>, is about going up, up, up.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/iDA33JqHIjE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>If this is your first time, here’s how it works: you can download <em>Poinpy<\/em> as a standalone app on <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.Poinpy\" target=\"_blank\">Android<\/a> or iOS, but to play it, you’ll need a Netflix subscription (or someone’s login). After launching the game, it’ll ask you to sign into Netflix — and even choose your individual profile if you’re sharing your sub — before playing. In other words, it’s a self-contained experience and you don’t even need the main Netflix app on your mobile device.<\/p>\n<p>As the trailer shows, the idea is to flick your character upwards with a bit of a time crunch to keep the pressure on. You’ll try to avoid accidentally colliding with foes while collecting certain combinations of fruit and climbing ever higher until your run comes crashing down and you go again. Much like <em>Downwell<\/em>, this quick-on-your-feet game is about being in the right place at the right time to keep your momentum flowing seamlessly without snags.<\/p>\n<p>It’s super vibrant, and while they look pretty different aesthetically speaking, <em>Poinpy<\/em> and <em>Downwell<\/em> feel like they belong on the same family tree.

That’s the allure of something new from Ojiro Fumoto, the creator of Downwell. The designer’s last game was about strategically plummeting, and this new one, Poinpy, is about going up, up, up.\n\nIf this is your first time, here’s how it works: you can download Poinpy as a standalone app on Android or iOS, but to play it, you’ll need a Netflix subscription (or someone’s login). After launching the game, it’ll ask you to sign into Netflix — and even choose your individual profile if you’re sharing your sub — before playing. In other words, it’s a self-contained experience and you don’t even need the main Netflix app on your mobile device.\nAs the trailer shows, the idea is to flick your character upwards with a bit of a time crunch to keep the pressure on. You’ll try to avoid accidentally colliding with foes while collecting certain combinations of fruit and climbing ever higher until your run comes crashing down and you go again. Much like Downwell, this quick-on-your-feet game is about being in the right place at the right time to keep your momentum flowing seamlessly without snags.\nIt’s super vibrant, and while they look pretty different aesthetically speaking, Poinpy and Downwell feel like they belong on the same family tree. It’s tricky! I’m not great at it.\nFumoto partnered with Netflix Games and Devolver Digital, and maybe if we’re lucky we’ll see Poinpy eventually land on other platforms. For now, though, this really feels like a game that was designed for touch controls. I’m sure it could work elsewhere just fine — and that’d be cool — but if you’ve got a Netflix account handy, give it a shot.\nHeh, “Poinpy.” Cute lil name.\n\n \n\nJordan is a founding member of Destructoid and poster of seemingly random pictures. They are anything but random.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tCMA filings show how the Activision Blizzard deal could help build the Xbox mobile store\nAmid investigations over Microsoft’s possible acquisition of Activision Blizzard, new details have emerged about its plans for a mobile store to compete with other platforms.\nMicrosoft’s Activision Blizzard deal is under investigation by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). As part of those filings, Microsoft says a motivation for the acquisition is to help build out its mobile presence.\nHere’s the relevant item from the CMA filing, as reported on by The Verge:\n“The transaction will improve Microsoft’s ability to create a next generation game store which operates across a range of devices, including mobile as a result of the addition of Activision Blizzard’s content. Building on Activision Blizzard’s existing communities of gamers, Xbox will seek to scale the Xbox Store to mobile, attracting gamers to a new Xbox Mobile Platform. Shifting consumers away from the Google Play Store and App Store on mobile devices will, however, require a major shift in consumer behavior. Microsoft hopes that by offering well-known and popular content, gamers will be more inclined to try something new.”\n\nA more mobile Xbox\nMicrosoft has been pushing more and more into the mobile market. Putting its cloud gaming service on phones makes for pretty good reasons to pick up a controller clip and game on the go.\nBut this new development could see Microsoft opening its own platform, one that would compete with Google’s Play Store and the App Store.\nMobile gaming revenue from Activision Blizzard is strong, as Microsoft notes in the filing. The output of the King side of Activision Blizzard, alongside games like Call of Duty: Mobile, represent a good chunk of revenue.\nThe acquisition remains under scrutiny though, as the CMA continues to investigate.\nIn other Activision Blizzard news, Blizzard Albany workers recently won approval for a union vote.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n \n",

On August 22, 2023, the dream was over, and the last screen was posted. But the beloved designer had another trick up his sleeve: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCv1DvRY5PyHHt3KN9ghunuw\/videos\">an entire YouTube channel!<\/a> The era of Sakurai YouTube has begun.<\/p>\n<p>Dubbed “Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games,” the channel will deal with creative topics pertaining to game design; with Sakurai speaking in Japanese, alongside English subtitles. It has a similar feel to his humble <em>Smash<\/em> DLC reveals, with Sakurai hanging out and talking (with purpose!).<\/p>\n<p>At the time of publication, he’s put out three videos on his channel to kick things off. If you’re remotely interested in game design and\/or Sakurai himself, all of these videos could be considered must-watches. They’re generally two to seven minutes long, and concisely touch on various topics utilizing Sakurai’s level of expertise.<\/p>\n<h2>A Sakurai YouTube “About This Channel” rundown:<\/h2>\n<p>Sakurai walks people through why he started the channel, and states upfront that people shouldn’t expect him to stream games from it. Rather, he’ll be “talking about topics like game development and what makes games fun.” Part of the purpose of the channel is to provide a wide net of education, which Sakurai says is more effective than speaking at an event to a limited crowd, or even giving talks at conferences like GDC.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7M-DnOIeasA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>Masahiro Sakurai’s Creative Works:<\/h2>\n<p>This extremely short sizzle reel is a quick speechless rundown of Sakurai’s career.

                "textplain": "\n\n\n \n\nRevealed directly after he stopped doing the “daily Smash Ultimate screen” tweets\nJust this week, we were reminded by Super Smash Bros. boss Masahiro Sakurai that the “daily Smash screens” fun was coming to an end. On August 22, 2023, the dream was over, and the last screen was posted. But the beloved designer had another trick up his sleeve: an entire YouTube channel! The era of Sakurai YouTube has begun.\nDubbed “Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games,” the channel will deal with creative topics pertaining to game design; with Sakurai speaking in Japanese, alongside English subtitles. It has a similar feel to his humble Smash DLC reveals, with Sakurai hanging out and talking (with purpose!).\nAt the time of publication, he’s put out three videos on his channel to kick things off. If you’re remotely interested in game design and\/or Sakurai himself, all of these videos could be considered must-watches. They’re generally two to seven minutes long, and concisely touch on various topics utilizing Sakurai’s level of expertise.\nA Sakurai YouTube “About This Channel” rundown:\nSakurai walks people through why he started the channel, and states upfront that people shouldn’t expect him to stream games from it. Rather, he’ll be “talking about topics like game development and what makes games fun.” Part of the purpose of the channel is to provide a wide net of education, which Sakurai says is more effective than speaking at an event to a limited crowd, or even giving talks at conferences like GDC.\n\nMasahiro Sakurai’s Creative Works:\nThis extremely short sizzle reel is a quick speechless rundown of Sakurai’s career. His credentials, as it were! Some text is provided to explain a few concepts.\n\nGame Design Specifics: Stop for Big Moments:\nAs the first major game design video, this clip has Sakurai explain “stop effects”; specifically “hit stop,” something he uses liberally in the Smash Bros. series. In short, he explains how stuff like zooming in and slowing down the action when finishing someone off in Smash Bros. can create more dramatic tension. Fascinatingly, he showcases that he’s been using that concept since the early days of the Kirby series, when you finish off a boss.\n\n\n \n\nReviews Director, Co-EIC - Chris has been enjoying Destructoid avidly since 2008. He finally decided to take the next step, make an account, and start blogging in January of 2009. Now, he's staff!\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tOverwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs\nNetflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service.

                "textplain": "\nWorld of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King Classic launches globally today and Destructoid sister site Icy Veins is here to tell you all about it, including an assortment of guides.\nGlobal Release Times\nWrath Classic launches in the Americas, Europe, Taiwan, Korea, and Australia\/New Zealand simultaneously. Check the details below for the exact time you can log in to the game and explore all that the new expansion has to offer.\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nNew Continent: Northrend – Heroes will begin their journey in one of two zones in Northrend — Borean Tundra or Howling Fjord. A vast new continent awaits!\nNew Hero Class: Death Knights – Available to both factions at Level 55, Death Knights harness the powers of darkness to help combat the evil that threatens Azeroth. In Wrath Classic, Blizard is bypassing the requirement for a player’s first Death Knight character, unless they decide to pick a fresh realm.\nNew Profession: Inscription – Scribe mystical glyphs that modify the properties of spells and abilities or create powerful trinkets and off-hand items.\nAchievements – Show off your accomplishments and earn various rewards in WoW Classic!\nDungeons &amp; Raids – Multiple new dungeons and 3 raids will be available during Phase 1.\n\nWrath of the Lich King Classic is included with existing World of Warcraft subscriptions. If you subscribe to World of Warcraft, you can also play Wrath of the Lich King Classic at no additional cost.\n\nNew Hero Class: Death Knight\nDeath Knights are a new Hero Class available in Wrath Classic. They start at Level 55 in Ebon Hold and have 3 specializations to choose from: Blood, Frost, and Unholy. You do not need an existing Level 55 character on the same realm to create your first Death Knight in Wrath Classic. Fresh start realms are an exception to the rule. Any Death Knight created after your first one must be on a different realm, and requires an existing Level 55 character on the same realm. Completing the Death Knight intro in Wrath Classic rewards the Frostbrood Proto-Wyrm mount on live servers.\nIf you’re playing a Death Knight in Wrath Classic, we have a set of guides specifically tailored to help you with leveling, gearing, talents, addons, and macros.\nDeath Knight PvE &amp; PvP Guides\nDeath Knight Gear Guides\nTalent Guides\nInscription is a new Profession that lets you craft powerful items called glyphs that enhance spells and abilities. Scribes can create various trinkets and off-hand items.\n\n\nWe’ve all been there! It is always difficult to choose a class, especially in an MMORPG like World of Warcraft, and when you finally decide which class to play, it’s time to start leveling! The cap has been raised to Level 80 in Wrath Classic (up from Level 70 in Burning Crusade Classic).\nIf you do not plan on maining a Death Knight, we have leveling guides for other classes as well with recommended builds and talents.\nDruid Leveling Guides\n\nDruid Leveling Guide\nBalance Druid Leveling Guide\nFeral DPS Druid Leveling Guide\nFeral Tank Druid Leveling Guide\nRestoration Druid Leveling Guide\n\nHunter Leveling Guides\n\nHunter Leveling Guide\nBeast Mastery Hunter Leveling Guide\nMarksmanship Hunter Leveling Guide\nSurvival Hunter Leveling Guide\n\nMage Leveling Guides\n\nMage Leveling Guide\nArcane Mage Leveling Guide\nFire Mage Leveling Guide\nFrost Mage ST Leveling Guide\nFrost Mage AoE Leveling Guide\n\n\nPaladin Leveling Guides\n\nPaladin Leveling Guide\nHoly Paladin Leveling Guide\nProtection Paladin Leveling Guide\nRetribution Paladin Leveling Guide\n\nPriest Leveling Guides\n\nPriest Leveling Guide\nDiscipline Priest Leveling Guide\nHoly Priest Leveling Guide\nShadow Priest Leveling Guide\n\nRogue Leveling Guides\n\nRogue Leveling Guide\nAssassination Rogue Leveling Guide\nCombat Rogue Leveling Guide\nSubtlety Rogue Leveling Guide\n\nShaman Leveling Guides\n\nShaman Leveling Guide\nElemental Shaman Leveling Guide\nEnhancement Shaman Leveling Guide\nRestoration Shaman Leveling Guide\n\nWarlock Leveling Guides\nAs of the time of writing this article, Warlock guides are in the process of being deployed on the site.

                "textplain": "\n\n\n \n\nWe’re coming home in 2022\nToday’s Nintendo Direct ended with the game we’ve been waiting to see for too long. In Yoshiaki Koizumi’s own words, “We announced this game in 2017, and we thank you for your patience. This game will launch next year.” Why yes, it’s none other than Bayonetta 3!\n“After what seems like 500 years, we’re proud to finally show the trailer,” said Platinum.\n\nThe main upgrade for Bayonetta 3 — or at least the first big one we’ve been privy to after finally getting a three-and-a-half-minute glimpse of this long-awaited Switch game — is the Demon Masquerade ability, which lets Bayonetta take control of beefy demons.\nMore than anything, I’m most stoked about the continuation of this wild, witchy world. We love this studio for its top-tier action gameplay, and I’d put Bayonetta in that bucket. I also really like the story, which seems like it’s ~going places~. I need to consult the lore.\nI have no real doubt that Bayonetta 3 will be another sweet game for action fans, and I trust in Platinum, but at the same time, this showing didn’t do much for me.\nThe big demon clashes are an interesting focal point, and I get why Nintendo would want to point at them for this showcase, they just don’t seem all that fun — so far, anyway. Granted, we’re missing the wider context, and we don’t know how prevalent this stuff will be in comparison to everything else the game is cooking up, so I’m trying not to judge too harshly here. As a show closer, even just as a “Bayonetta 3 trailer,” I’m underwhelmed.\n\nIt’s nice to have this reveal out of the way — so we can all finally chill for a bit — and I look forward to seeing more footage in the lead-up to the 2022 launch.\nWhat do you think the shadowy tease at the end is getting at? And how do you feel about Bayonetta’s new look? Bayonetta 2 is a tough act to follow, and I’m rooting for Bayo 3.\n“We’re in the home stretch of development right now, working on making the core of the game even more fun and test playing nonstop,” said director Yusuke Miyata. “As the culmination of this series loved by all of you, we’re giving our all to make it a masterpiece worthy of the name Bayonetta so please wait and anticipate just a bit longer!”\n\n \n\nJordan is a founding member of Destructoid and poster of seemingly random pictures.

As you can clearly see, the latter use is outdated, and has been for some time, basically putting My Nintendo in a dormant state. But with physical rewards arriving recently, it’s given the service a second wind.<\/p>\n<p>So this step is the easiest. <a href=\"https:\/\/my.nintendo.com\/missions\" target=\"_blank\">Go make a My Nintendo account<\/a>, then link your proper Nintendo account. Head to the “missions” section: this is your dashboard, where you’ll start making notes of what to do to earn Platinum Points.<\/p>\n<p>Make a few quick changes to get some easy points. Link your Nintendo account, turn promotional emails on (and keep them on for recurring points), and link various social accounts (Facebook\/Google\/Twitter) for more points. If you’re uncomfortable with this prospect, link bogus accounts. Also don’t forget to tour the Mario 35 site and click around for more easy points.<\/p>\n<p>The Cold Stone code is an odd one, but an option. You can get 100 points if you order a <em>Mario<\/em>-themed menu item, and the best way to do that without incident is online. Make a Cold Stone account, then order an item ahead of time for pickup. Make sure the “My Nintendo” promo is enabled. Some folks are reporting that it works online for all menu items as long as the code is applied (even the cheapest menu items possible, like sides), but do this at your own risk. My wife ordered a Mario shake online, and we were able to do curbside pickup: the point code was emailed to me a few hours later. <a href=\"https:\/\/mario.nintendo.com\/missions\/\" target=\"_blank\">Enter it here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Another source of recurring points is the “monthly Nintendo newsletter.” Note that sometimes you’ll be required to locate a number code in the actual email, <a href=\"https:\/\/my.nintendo.com\/serial_number\" target=\"_blank\">which can be redeemed for points on this page<\/a>. Emails can appear sporadically or not at all, so keep an eye out for them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When you actually use the points<\/strong>, you’re basically “buying” a digital code. You use that code to make the item free: then pay shipping (which is around $5). Use this opportunity to stack items together, as one purchase only incurs one flat shipping fee.

The usual!<\/p>\n<p>After jumping out of a boat and gaining control of Alcedor, I hopped back in to see if I could talk to a pixelated sailor. I could — and he shared the wisdom nugget that “You’ll drown if you fall in the water,” which is exactly the sort of reaction I was hoping for as a <em>Simon’s Quest<\/em> fan. Chatting up the local weirdos is part of the charm, especially in town.<\/p>\n<p>The trailer for <em>Infernax<\/em> sets up a choice-based “good” or “evil” playthrough, and sure enough, I quickly ran into a villager who looked like he was about to turn into something vile. I was able to “Slay” or “Pray,” and my choice led to a mutated mini-boss fight. I’m curious how far we’ll be able to take things in the full game, but my curiosity is piqued.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Infernax-Slay-or-Pray-screenshot.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" alt=\"The old moral choice to &quot;Slay&quot; or &quot;Pray&quot;\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Early on in my time with <em>Infernax<\/em>, I had to fight the urge to grind for currency and XP. It was <em>so tempting<\/em>. I couldn’t resist jumping back and forth between screens to re-kill the same group of foes. At shrines, you can save and top up your health, and also upgrade your power, health, and mana. Early-game Alcedor is more fragile than you might expect, whether we’re talking death by a thousand cuts against basic creeps or big hits in actual boss fights. Interestingly, after death, there’s a Casual and Hardcore restart.<\/p>\n<p>The Hardcore restart takes you back to your last manual save point, and it’s meant for folks who want a more authentic, unforgiving experience (and presumably an eventual achievement payoff), while Casual sends you immediately back into the fray — it’s a do-over. After choosing the Casual restart even once, the Hardcore choice is revoked.<\/p>\n<p>I feel like I’ll probably go through <em>Infernax<\/em> with Casual restarts in mind to get a feel for everything without taking things too slowly, then circle back for another playthrough with patient, methodical, not-too-risky practices in mind to make the Hardcore clear feasible. You do you, though! Even with grinding, I feel like the game will likely get pretty tough. In the opening half-hour or so, I didn’t encounter anything I’d describe as “cheap,” so we’ll see what old-school action-platformer nastiness might be in store later.<\/p>\n<p>Outside of bosses, including one that was part of an optional backtrack-at-night quest, the starter enemies were easy to take out so long as I wasn’t overwhelmed by pesky group-ups. Further into the preview build, one particular skeleton proved to be trickier in terms of its protected weak point and alternating movements, almost in a <em>Zelda II<\/em> sort of way, which I appreciated. (Nothing a lightning spell couldn’t help me handle; on a second run-through, I picked up a healing spell instead. Both of them felt powerful.)<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Infernax-skeleton-knight-screenshot.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" alt=\"Infernax has slight Zelda II vibes\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I’m not sure if there are any plans to release this slice of the game to the public as a demo, even just as a limited-time offering in, say, a Steam Fest, but I think it would sell people on <em>Infernax<\/em>. This brief run through a <em>Castlevania<\/em>-inspired playground made me realize how much I miss the series’ original vibe, even now in 2022. It feels just fresh enough.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike the screwball <em>Simon’s Quest<\/em>, I’m pretty sure <em>Infernax<\/em> will be palatable to a wider audience. As much as I hope there are finicky secrets to figure out, I’m totally fine with (what appears to be) a less obtuse progression path. Enough breathing room for players to explore and make discoveries without leading them so astray that a guide feels mandatory — that’s my ideal balance. It’s got a fun darkly humorous tone to it, too.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/NpwNTLiorCk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>I’ve scratched the surface of this game — the preview build ended quickly enough that I was compelled to play it over again without a second thought — but I can say that it’s on the right track.

Chatting up the local weirdos is part of the charm, especially in town.\nThe trailer for Infernax sets up a choice-based “good” or “evil” playthrough, and sure enough, I quickly ran into a villager who looked like he was about to turn into something vile. I was able to “Slay” or “Pray,” and my choice led to a mutated mini-boss fight. I’m curious how far we’ll be able to take things in the full game, but my curiosity is piqued.\n\nEarly on in my time with Infernax, I had to fight the urge to grind for currency and XP. It was so tempting. I couldn’t resist jumping back and forth between screens to re-kill the same group of foes. At shrines, you can save and top up your health, and also upgrade your power, health, and mana. Early-game Alcedor is more fragile than you might expect, whether we’re talking death by a thousand cuts against basic creeps or big hits in actual boss fights. Interestingly, after death, there’s a Casual and Hardcore restart.\nThe Hardcore restart takes you back to your last manual save point, and it’s meant for folks who want a more authentic, unforgiving experience (and presumably an eventual achievement payoff), while Casual sends you immediately back into the fray — it’s a do-over. After choosing the Casual restart even once, the Hardcore choice is revoked.\nI feel like I’ll probably go through Infernax with Casual restarts in mind to get a feel for everything without taking things too slowly, then circle back for another playthrough with patient, methodical, not-too-risky practices in mind to make the Hardcore clear feasible. You do you, though! Even with grinding, I feel like the game will likely get pretty tough. In the opening half-hour or so, I didn’t encounter anything I’d describe as “cheap,” so we’ll see what old-school action-platformer nastiness might be in store later.\nOutside of bosses, including one that was part of an optional backtrack-at-night quest, the starter enemies were easy to take out so long as I wasn’t overwhelmed by pesky group-ups. Further into the preview build, one particular skeleton proved to be trickier in terms of its protected weak point and alternating movements, almost in a Zelda II sort of way, which I appreciated. (Nothing a lightning spell couldn’t help me handle; on a second run-through, I picked up a healing spell instead. Both of them felt powerful.)\n\nI’m not sure if there are any plans to release this slice of the game to the public as a demo, even just as a limited-time offering in, say, a Steam Fest, but I think it would sell people on Infernax. This brief run through a Castlevania-inspired playground made me realize how much I miss the series’ original vibe, even now in 2022. It feels just fresh enough.\nUnlike the screwball Simon’s Quest, I’m pretty sure Infernax will be palatable to a wider audience. As much as I hope there are finicky secrets to figure out, I’m totally fine with (what appears to be) a less obtuse progression path. Enough breathing room for players to explore and make discoveries without leading them so astray that a guide feels mandatory — that’s my ideal balance. It’s got a fun darkly humorous tone to it, too.\n\nI’ve scratched the surface of this game — the preview build ended quickly enough that I was compelled to play it over again without a second thought — but I can say that it’s on the right track. If you like old-school Castlevania, and you’re open to some more modern touches, chances are, you’ll dig this game. You made it this far into the article, after all.\nBerzerk Studio and The Arcade Crew plan to release Infernax for PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X\/S on February 14, 2022.\n\n \n\nJordan is a founding member of Destructoid and poster of seemingly random pictures.

It’s since been ported to many other platforms and now, years and years later, it pops up again on Nintendo Switch.\nYou can check out the trailer here:\n\nNo details have been listed yet about whether this will have any new enhancements or features.\nGenerations of war\nIf you’re unfamiliar with Record of Agarest War, it’s a strategy RPG with a dating twist. Developed as a collaboration between Compile Heart, Red Entertainment, and Idea Factory, you play as several different protagonists embroiled in conflict.\nBut the way you navigate through the plot is, well, through generations. As the first protagonist, you can romance and marry one of several party members. Then, your child goes on to be protagonist number 2. This plays out across several generations, with the chosen bride affecting the next hero’s stats and aspects of their appearance.\nSo yes, fans of Fire Emblem: Awakening‘s child-unit min-maxing might want to take note. This is a bit of a surprise, as Agarest War has been a more niche series in the pantheon of SRPG discussion. But the genre has been surging, with both new titles and remasters of old classics. It looks like Aksys wasn’t going to let Agarest War sit on the sidelines for this tactical resurgence.\nThe news arrived as part of an Aksys announcement stream, alongside several other game announcements. Cuddly Forest Friends is set to arrive on Switch in 2023, Spooky Spirit Shooting Gallery heads to Switch in summer 2023, and Tengoku Struggle -Strayside- is set for Switch in 2024.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n \n",

                "content": "<div>\n<h2>From zero to no more hero<\/h2>\n<p>“If you identify with this loser, you have problems.”<\/p>\n<p>That’s what Game Informer said about Travis Touchdown, the star of the <em>No More Heroes<\/em> series, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JZBeast\/status\/1425248489706033153\" target=\"_blank\">in a list of “Top Ten Dorks of 2008.”<\/a> Not the highest of praise, but in a way, they had a point. As it turns out, a lot of people who love games also happen to suffer from social anxiety, identity confusion, a history of trauma, and other problems. Like anyone, they want to see themselves represented in the media they enjoy, and when it comes to mass-market gaming, it can be tough to find honest representation. That’s still true now, and it was even more true 13 years ago.<\/p>\n<p>In an industry striving for AAA, 10\/10 perfection, Travis busted in screaming “I’m a big, broken idiot!”, and we loved him for it. Seeing him ridiculed by the establishment could be frustrating, but in the end, it only added to his time-tested, underdog charm. With three sequels, a Mii costume in <em>Smash Bros.<\/em>, and even a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=13rhrr86_CI\">jazz album (!)<\/a> under his belt, Travis has proven that losers like him can win. Not bad for an old dork from 2008.<\/p>\n<p>With its third, and maybe final numbered game on the horizon, <em>No More Heroes<\/em> curiosity is at an all-time high, and what better way to both satisfy that curiosity and, er, “stoke” it than with a video game blog! If you’ve always wanted to know more about the franchise, or if you’re just looking to refresh your memory on Travis’ history, <strong>here’s a spoiler-free<\/strong>, sometimes cryptic, recap of the <em>No More Heroes<\/em> story so far.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ZDhGYN2-iQA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3><em><strong>No More Heroes <\/strong><\/em><\/h3>\n<p>Travis kicks off his first story with a hyper-active monologue about how he bought a beam katana online and plans to use it to become a great assassin. From the start, the game rides the line between parody and tribute. Is it making fun of “cool nerds and the games they love,” or is it glorifying them? Can it do both at the same time? The tension in that question buzzes below the surface for the entirety of <em>No More Heroes<\/em>‘ run-time.<\/p>\n<p>Travis is a powerful warrior who takes on hordes of blood-thirsty rivals all at once. He’s the textbook definition of a “cool, badass action hero.” The way he’s forced to do the “jerk off” motion with his sword in front of everyone in order to recharge it, leaving him vulnerable to both physical and emotional attacks at the same time? That’s less “badass” and more “<a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/suda51-announces-killer7-for-steam-at-momocon-2018\/\" target=\"_blank\">jackass<\/a>,” and that split down the middle between stud and dud doesn’t end there. He gets two kinds of phone calls every day: invitations to an underground society of assassins, and voicemails from the local video store listing all the pornos he owes late fees on. He splits his time between menial work and murdering murderers.<\/p>\n<p>For a lot of us, Travis is how we look in a funhouse mirror — ridiculously exaggerated, volatile, but still a reflection of reality. He’s a guy we can both laugh at and laugh with, look down on him with one eye, look up to with the other.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/E_4-2q4AR1c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Isolation is the unifying factor in Travis’ fractured life. He has a cat, who he silently pets, and a minor acquaintance named Bishop, but other than that, he’s going it alone. Over the course of the game, we come to find that there are reasons for that. Travis didn’t enter the world of competitive killing just for shits and giggles. As his battles against the bosses become increasingly strange, it becomes clearer that <em>No More Heroes<\/em> isn’t just another dumb action-comedy. It’s about Travis’ love\/hate relationship with violence, and with himself. He’s trapped by it, struggling to find the exit, and in the end, it seems never-ending. There’s joy and pain in that, and more than anything, there’s truth.<\/p>\n<p>For many,<em> No More Heroes<\/em> was their gateway into this deeper world of symbolism-heavy “auteur gaming.” It sold itself with novelty and brutality, but that was just to get you in the door. Once it gets its hooks in you, it takes you to places you may not have otherwise chosen to go. A cutscene near the end of the game tells a story so shocking, disturbing, and sad that parts of it actually play in fast motion so you don’t have to hear it. That’s how suppressing trauma works. You gloss over it, try to speed through your recollection of it so you don’t have to fully re-experience it. But of course, players were curious and slowed down this part of the “tape” to hear what really happened.<\/p>\n<p>After they did, they could never look at Travis the same way again. His story, and the story of his family, was a true tragedy. All this time, he’d been fighting to try to make peace with his shared familial trauma, to somehow make it right.<\/p>\n<p>But you can’t go back in time and kill the past. All you can do is move forward. That’s something Travis finally starts to do in his next game.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/W7_qr-_V1NU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3><em><strong>No More Heroes 1.5<\/strong><\/em><\/h3>\n<p>But before we get to the next chapter in Travis’ life, let’s talk a little about this largely unknown side story. The Japanese special edition of <em>No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle<\/em> included a short animatic film called <em>No More Heroes 1.5<\/em>. It’s unessential but interesting; a bit of optional fun that sets the stage for the next major chapter in Travis’ life.<\/p>\n<p>For the most part, he’s still the same guy, alone in a dead-end town. The main difference is, he’s become a famous assassin, and lower-level killers are gunning for his title. It’s a bit of symbolism that some may say is a smidge too on the nose: he even battles a guy who looks exactly like him. His first game had become a cult hit, and it got there by being like nothing else gaming had ever seen. With this sequel, <em>No More Heroes<\/em> would have to continue to compete against all the other games on the market, and also start fighting with itself. Comparisons between the new game and the old were inevitable.<\/p>\n<p>Travis’ appeal hinged on his punk rock persona, his willingness to do what no other gaming mascot would. How could he preserve that unpredictable edge while also giving his fans the same fun they’d come to expect from him?<\/p>\n<p>A hero is largely defined by their villains, and to move his story forward, Travis would need a new foe to juxtapose against. <em>No More Heroes 1.5<\/em> offers some foreshadowing on this new threat — a pizza mogul who’s looking to transform Travis’ town into a sterile, corporate wasteland. If Travis is Johnny Knoxville, a homegrown, do-it-yourself anti-celebrity, then his opposite would be a privileged, brand-obsessed brat, living his life in an ivory tower. Travis’ next full story would focus on the climb to topple this monster, and how the heights he’d reach to get there would give him plenty of room for a fall.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/PIVQ2Wunz3k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3><em><strong>No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle<\/strong><\/em><\/h3>\n<p>The <em>No More Heroes<\/em> games can be pretty blunt, so it feels right to just come out and say that <em>No More Heroes 2<\/em> failed as a product. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/reviews\/review-no-more-heroes-2-desperate-struggle\/\" target=\"_blank\">I love the game<\/a>, even more than the first — but the game just didn’t bring in the new fans that most game sequels are designed to attract. In fact, it may have actually lost some people.<\/p>\n<p>Suda51 wrote and directed the first game, but by the second, he was juggling multiple projects. He wasn’t as involved with this one, and you can sense it. Everything here feels a little more self-conscious and catering. For fans who loved how the first game seemed too drunk to be tactful, too unhinged to be anything but fully authentic, <em>No More Heroes 2<\/em> seemed like a step towards conventionality by comparison.<\/p>\n<p>Some critics picked on the first game for its large, and largely empty, open-world. The second one cut that entirely. The sometimes tedious menial jobs were also ditched, except for the scorpion one, because Suda seems to love the idea of Travis catching scorpions. All the others were replaced with breezy and delightful retro-style mini-games.<\/p>\n<p>The story was also less toothy. Nothing in <em>No More Heroes 2<\/em> is so disturbing that it needs to be fast-forwarded over in order to keep it from getting an AO rating. Overall, it feels more like a crowd-pleaser; like a sophomore album by a hardcore band that’s going ever-so-slightly pop.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/VqfL0Ret1o8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>But pop can also be deep. The story of <em>No More Heroes 2<\/em> is no less substantive than the first. It’s just told in a less overtly weird way. Things start with Travis being given a reason to seek revenge, and it’s flimsy as hell. At first blush, it may seem like just another ham-fisted MacGuffin, but it’s really a way to reframe Travis’ real defining trait: his loneliness. If your best friend is someone who you barely know or care about, you must not have many friends at all. That’s Travis at the start of <em>No More Heroes 2<\/em> — a more genuinely confident killer, but still a clown who doesn’t know how to connect.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike the first game, which was mostly about unpeeling the layers of Travis’ psyche, the second <em>No More Heroes<\/em> is about how he changes. Through the game, he becomes a different person. His hot pursuit for revenge begins to burn a hole in him. It hurts, and not much makes it feel better. The body count piles up, and he begins to hate it, and himself. This pain motivates him to try something new: giving a shit about other people, and letting them into his life.<\/p>\n<p>In the first game, the only person to ever enter Travis’ motel room is Travis. By the end of the second major chapter in his franchise, not one, not two, but three other people are invited in. Two of them are even playable characters! Travis, and the player, are learning to empathize, to see others outside themselves as just as real as them.<\/p>\n<p>This increased capacity for intimacy comes to a head (literally) in the final fight. Though Travis seems a little too dumb to see it, the man who he came to hate so much is a lot like him. He’s alone, motivated by the urge to make others suffer as he has suffered, and he desires to amass power for power’s sake. But where do you have to go when you reach the top, when you finally cut off the head of a giant? The only place to go is down. Luckily for Travis, there’s someone there to catch him. The bonds he formed with friends and family turn out to be stronger than he thought. Strong enough to save him.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Ch_2MBzfmXY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3><strong><em>Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There was a nine-year span between <em>No More Heroes 2<\/em> and this spin-off, and that decade is reflected in the narrative. Travis has aged in real-time, and when we catch up with him, he looks more isolated than ever. How did he lose everything he gained in his last story? How did he end up in a trailer in the woods, alone with his cat, fending off attacks from drunken middle-aged baseball players?<\/p>\n<p>At first, it seems like video games are to blame, but like most things with Travis, there’s a lot more to it than that.<\/p>\n<p><em>Travis Strikes Again<\/em> is actually split into three different stories: the one told through cutscenes and gameplay, the one told through text-based faxes that Travis receives through his home-office fax machine, and the one told in a supplemental visual novel called <em>Travis Strikes Back<\/em>. All of these stories feel autobiographical. Suda51 was back in the director’s chair for this one, with at least nine years of pent-up ideas ready to go, and only a small “indie-style” side story with which to tell them.<\/p>\n<p>At times it can all seem like too much, trying to follow the seemingly disconnected narrative threads, but they’re all connected. <em>Travis Strikes Again<\/em> is about Travis moving to the next big conflict in his life: the psycho-social stage of emotional development called Generativity vs. Stagnation. He may look to be alone at first, but before long, he’s fighting alongside one of the victims of his past crimes, trying to make it right. His pet is no longer just a silent companion, there to help him pass the time. They’re now a partnership, and one of many. Travis also doesn’t kill anymore, at least, not in the way he used to.

                "textplain": "\nFrom zero to no more hero\n“If you identify with this loser, you have problems.”\nThat’s what Game Informer said about Travis Touchdown, the star of the No More Heroes series, in a list of “Top Ten Dorks of 2008.” Not the highest of praise, but in a way, they had a point. As it turns out, a lot of people who love games also happen to suffer from social anxiety, identity confusion, a history of trauma, and other problems. Like anyone, they want to see themselves represented in the media they enjoy, and when it comes to mass-market gaming, it can be tough to find honest representation. That’s still true now, and it was even more true 13 years ago.\nIn an industry striving for AAA, 10\/10 perfection, Travis busted in screaming “I’m a big, broken idiot!”, and we loved him for it. Seeing him ridiculed by the establishment could be frustrating, but in the end, it only added to his time-tested, underdog charm. With three sequels, a Mii costume in Smash Bros., and even a jazz album (!) under his belt, Travis has proven that losers like him can win. Not bad for an old dork from 2008.\nWith its third, and maybe final numbered game on the horizon, No More Heroes curiosity is at an all-time high, and what better way to both satisfy that curiosity and, er, “stoke” it than with a video game blog! If you’ve always wanted to know more about the franchise, or if you’re just looking to refresh your memory on Travis’ history, here’s a spoiler-free, sometimes cryptic, recap of the No More Heroes story so far.\n\nNo More Heroes \nTravis kicks off his first story with a hyper-active monologue about how he bought a beam katana online and plans to use it to become a great assassin. From the start, the game rides the line between parody and tribute. Is it making fun of “cool nerds and the games they love,” or is it glorifying them? Can it do both at the same time? The tension in that question buzzes below the surface for the entirety of No More Heroes‘ run-time.\nTravis is a powerful warrior who takes on hordes of blood-thirsty rivals all at once. He’s the textbook definition of a “cool, badass action hero.” The way he’s forced to do the “jerk off” motion with his sword in front of everyone in order to recharge it, leaving him vulnerable to both physical and emotional attacks at the same time? That’s less “badass” and more “jackass,” and that split down the middle between stud and dud doesn’t end there. He gets two kinds of phone calls every day: invitations to an underground society of assassins, and voicemails from the local video store listing all the pornos he owes late fees on. He splits his time between menial work and murdering murderers.\nFor a lot of us, Travis is how we look in a funhouse mirror — ridiculously exaggerated, volatile, but still a reflection of reality. He’s a guy we can both laugh at and laugh with, look down on him with one eye, look up to with the other.\n\nIsolation is the unifying factor in Travis’ fractured life. He has a cat, who he silently pets, and a minor acquaintance named Bishop, but other than that, he’s going it alone. Over the course of the game, we come to find that there are reasons for that. Travis didn’t enter the world of competitive killing just for shits and giggles. As his battles against the bosses become increasingly strange, it becomes clearer that No More Heroes isn’t just another dumb action-comedy. It’s about Travis’ love\/hate relationship with violence, and with himself. He’s trapped by it, struggling to find the exit, and in the end, it seems never-ending. There’s joy and pain in that, and more than anything, there’s truth.\nFor many, No More Heroes was their gateway into this deeper world of symbolism-heavy “auteur gaming.” It sold itself with novelty and brutality, but that was just to get you in the door. Once it gets its hooks in you, it takes you to places you may not have otherwise chosen to go. A cutscene near the end of the game tells a story so shocking, disturbing, and sad that parts of it actually play in fast motion so you don’t have to hear it. That’s how suppressing trauma works. You gloss over it, try to speed through your recollection of it so you don’t have to fully re-experience it. But of course, players were curious and slowed down this part of the “tape” to hear what really happened.\nAfter they did, they could never look at Travis the same way again. His story, and the story of his family, was a true tragedy. All this time, he’d been fighting to try to make peace with his shared familial trauma, to somehow make it right.\nBut you can’t go back in time and kill the past. All you can do is move forward. That’s something Travis finally starts to do in his next game.\n\nNo More Heroes 1.5\nBut before we get to the next chapter in Travis’ life, let’s talk a little about this largely unknown side story. The Japanese special edition of No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle included a short animatic film called No More Heroes 1.5. It’s unessential but interesting; a bit of optional fun that sets the stage for the next major chapter in Travis’ life.\nFor the most part, he’s still the same guy, alone in a dead-end town. The main difference is, he’s become a famous assassin, and lower-level killers are gunning for his title. It’s a bit of symbolism that some may say is a smidge too on the nose: he even battles a guy who looks exactly like him. His first game had become a cult hit, and it got there by being like nothing else gaming had ever seen. With this sequel, No More Heroes would have to continue to compete against all the other games on the market, and also start fighting with itself. Comparisons between the new game and the old were inevitable.\nTravis’ appeal hinged on his punk rock persona, his willingness to do what no other gaming mascot would. How could he preserve that unpredictable edge while also giving his fans the same fun they’d come to expect from him?\nA hero is largely defined by their villains, and to move his story forward, Travis would need a new foe to juxtapose against. No More Heroes 1.5 offers some foreshadowing on this new threat — a pizza mogul who’s looking to transform Travis’ town into a sterile, corporate wasteland. If Travis is Johnny Knoxville, a homegrown, do-it-yourself anti-celebrity, then his opposite would be a privileged, brand-obsessed brat, living his life in an ivory tower. Travis’ next full story would focus on the climb to topple this monster, and how the heights he’d reach to get there would give him plenty of room for a fall.\n\nNo More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle\nThe No More Heroes games can be pretty blunt, so it feels right to just come out and say that No More Heroes 2 failed as a product. I love the game, even more than the first — but the game just didn’t bring in the new fans that most game sequels are designed to attract. In fact, it may have actually lost some people.\nSuda51 wrote and directed the first game, but by the second, he was juggling multiple projects. He wasn’t as involved with this one, and you can sense it. Everything here feels a little more self-conscious and catering. For fans who loved how the first game seemed too drunk to be tactful, too unhinged to be anything but fully authentic, No More Heroes 2 seemed like a step towards conventionality by comparison.\nSome critics picked on the first game for its large, and largely empty, open-world. The second one cut that entirely. The sometimes tedious menial jobs were also ditched, except for the scorpion one, because Suda seems to love the idea of Travis catching scorpions. All the others were replaced with breezy and delightful retro-style mini-games.\nThe story was also less toothy. Nothing in No More Heroes 2 is so disturbing that it needs to be fast-forwarded over in order to keep it from getting an AO rating. Overall, it feels more like a crowd-pleaser; like a sophomore album by a hardcore band that’s going ever-so-slightly pop.\n\nBut pop can also be deep. The story of No More Heroes 2 is no less substantive than the first. It’s just told in a less overtly weird way. Things start with Travis being given a reason to seek revenge, and it’s flimsy as hell. At first blush, it may seem like just another ham-fisted MacGuffin, but it’s really a way to reframe Travis’ real defining trait: his loneliness. If your best friend is someone who you barely know or care about, you must not have many friends at all. That’s Travis at the start of No More Heroes 2 — a more genuinely confident killer, but still a clown who doesn’t know how to connect.\nUnlike the first game, which was mostly about unpeeling the layers of Travis’ psyche, the second No More Heroes is about how he changes. Through the game, he becomes a different person. His hot pursuit for revenge begins to burn a hole in him. It hurts, and not much makes it feel better. The body count piles up, and he begins to hate it, and himself. This pain motivates him to try something new: giving a shit about other people, and letting them into his life.\nIn the first game, the only person to ever enter Travis’ motel room is Travis. By the end of the second major chapter in his franchise, not one, not two, but three other people are invited in. Two of them are even playable characters! Travis, and the player, are learning to empathize, to see others outside themselves as just as real as them.\nThis increased capacity for intimacy comes to a head (literally) in the final fight. Though Travis seems a little too dumb to see it, the man who he came to hate so much is a lot like him. He’s alone, motivated by the urge to make others suffer as he has suffered, and he desires to amass power for power’s sake. But where do you have to go when you reach the top, when you finally cut off the head of a giant? The only place to go is down. Luckily for Travis, there’s someone there to catch him. The bonds he formed with friends and family turn out to be stronger than he thought. Strong enough to save him.\n\nTravis Strikes Again: No More Heroes\nThere was a nine-year span between No More Heroes 2 and this spin-off, and that decade is reflected in the narrative. Travis has aged in real-time, and when we catch up with him, he looks more isolated than ever. How did he lose everything he gained in his last story? How did he end up in a trailer in the woods, alone with his cat, fending off attacks from drunken middle-aged baseball players?\nAt first, it seems like video games are to blame, but like most things with Travis, there’s a lot more to it than that.\nTravis Strikes Again is actually split into three different stories: the one told through cutscenes and gameplay, the one told through text-based faxes that Travis receives through his home-office fax machine, and the one told in a supplemental visual novel called Travis Strikes Back. All of these stories feel autobiographical. Suda51 was back in the director’s chair for this one, with at least nine years of pent-up ideas ready to go, and only a small “indie-style” side story with which to tell them.\nAt times it can all seem like too much, trying to follow the seemingly disconnected narrative threads, but they’re all connected. Travis Strikes Again is about Travis moving to the next big conflict in his life: the psycho-social stage of emotional development called Generativity vs. Stagnation. He may look to be alone at first, but before long, he’s fighting alongside one of the victims of his past crimes, trying to make it right. His pet is no longer just a silent companion, there to help him pass the time. They’re now a partnership, and one of many. Travis also doesn’t kill anymore, at least, not in the way he used to. Most of the enemies in the games are computer bugs, flaws in the system that Travis is working to fix. The bosses, like in past No More Heroes games, are an opportunity for Travis to reflect on himself, for better and for worse. Like Doppelganger, the last boss of the second level, is he nothing but a psychopathic killer who sees people as ants to be squashed? Or, like Eight-Hearts, a refugee of the damned, is he a gameplay tool that has evolved into a man; a full human being who is willing to die so something larger than himself can live?\n\nOr would he rather just play video games and smoke drugs all day on another planet?\nThere are some yes or no answers to these questions, but it’s never that cut and dried. The fact that Travis is even asking them shows that he exists in the shades of grey between them. He wants to be a good person, but only because he knows that parts of him are genuinely bad. He loves video games, but he also knows that in a way, they can be life killers. In the end, it’s revealed that his real motivation is to take care of his family, even if that means never seeing them again. Is he making the right choices? It’s never clear. But that’s how he knows he’s alive, that he’s really challenging himself. That’s what grownup Travis is all about. He’s still media-obsessed, but he’s not anti-social anymore, despite his new life of self-imposed isolation.\nThis kind of self-contradiction, and the tension it creates, is classic Suda. Some were disappointed that Travis Strikes Again wasn’t a return to the classic No More Heroes gameplay, but diehard Suda fans saw it as a return to form for Grasshopper Manufacture, who had been growing more conventional over the years. This new, weird little game was Suda and Travis doing the things that only they would do, reflecting where Suda is as an artist at this point in his career, and inviting you to either come along or not.\nLike every game in the series, it feels like it was made with no expectations of there ever being more. But there will be more very soon, and it’s hard not to talk about.\n\nLooking ahead to No More Heroes 3\nAs of this writing, I’ve played through No More Heroes 3 in a pre-release build, and then spent another eight hours just wandering around its open world, relaxing and looking for Easter eggs. I can’t say a lot due to the embargo, though I will tell you that Travis has struck again…. again. Will the game be Suda’s biggest hit yet? Will it be in the right place at the right time, just like it was in its 2008 debut? If not, it won’t be for a lack of consistency.

I really, really can’t wait to see how the No More Heroes fan community reacts to this one. I think they just might lose it.\n\n \n\n\"Where do dreams end and reality begin?

                "textplain": "\nLong-rumored remake finally announced\nSquare Enix has finally decided the time is right to officially lift the lid on one of the industry’s worst-kept secrets — the iconic developer has announced that Tactics Ogre: Reborn will launch on PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo Switch platforms on November 11.\nTactics Ogre: Reborn is a fresh remake of 2010 PSP release Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together. Further confuddling matters, the 2010 release was, in itself, a remake of the 1995 Super Famicom edition of Let Us Cling Together — a title which would receive both PlayStation and Sega Saturn ports in the mid-’90s, but never venture outside of Japanese shores in any official capacity.\n\nSquare Enix has revealed some of the exciting new features that are coming to Tactics Ogre: Reborn, bringing its fantasy worlds and strategic gameplay to a whole new audience of players. The beautifully detailed backgrounds and splash art have been fully recreated in high-definition, while the classic pixel appearance of the in-game characters has been tweaked to be crisper than ever before, while still retaining their delightful retro appeal. In addition, the U.I. has been streamlined and tweaked, offering a tidier menu system and optimized controls for new players.\nAll sound effects have been remastered to the highest fidelity, and all dialogue is now fully voiced, with Tactics Ogre: Reborn offering both Japanese and English voice tracks. Hitoshi Sakimoto’s lavish soundtrack has been fully rerecorded with a live orchestra, bringing the score to life like never before.

                "textplain": "\nThe upcomers take on Street Fighter‘s finest\nThe next generation of Street Fighter is aiming for 2023. Today, we got a look at what’s in store for Street Fighter 6 with some new trailers, featuring fighters, commentary, and a new single-player mode.\nToday’s State of Play trailer showed some full-on fights in the new engine, which according to the PlayStation blog is Capcom’s own RE Engine. The general look is a bit more colorful, with lots of paint and graffiti splashes.\nAs for the roster? First up are two newcomers. Well, relative newcomers; Luke already made his debut in Street Fighter V as a preview of what’s in store. He uses mixed martial arts and can pull off DDTs on people. Jamie, meanwhile, is a peacekeeper who follows in the footsteps of Yun and Yang. Returning to the roster are also Ryu and Chun-Li, who need little introduction.\n\nThe Drive System\nThe new mechanic this time is the Drive System, which can be used to perform five different techniques based on what you need. A Drive Reversal, for example, can perform a counterattack to get out of a sticky spot. Drive Parry, meanwhile, parries an attack and refills the Drive Gauge. Drive Impact looks similar to a Focus Attack, as it’s a powerful hit that can absorb an attack and can wall splat.\n\nWith Drive Rush, you can close the distance quick. And Overdrive Arts are essentially EX Moves, powering up Special Moves. It seems like a lot at first, but also combines a lot of different ideas from Street Fighter past into one universal metric.\nSwitching up controls\nAnother big note from today’s reveal and corresponding blog post is a new control system. For those used to classic Street Fighter inputs, there is Classic Control Type. It’s the good ol’ six-button layout and regular inputs.\nIn Street Fighter 6 though, there will also be a Modern Control Type, which allows special moves to be performed by combining a Special Move button with a directional input. Games like Granblue: Fantasy Versus have implemented similar systems in the past, and now it looks like Street Fighter is hopping on the train.\n\nA Real Time Commentary is also being added, where Capcom will collaborate with real-life fighting game commentators to add their voices into the game. They’ll narrate your play and add that tournament feel to matches. Vicious and Aru are the first confirmed additions, and the rest of the lineup is on the way later.\nCapcom also showed two different modes: World Tour and Battle Hub. World Tour is an “immersive” single-player story mode where you’ll have a player avatar. And Battle Hub looks like a massive thunderdome venue for online matches. They were only teased, as Capcom says both modes will get a deeper dive in the future.\n\nIt was a pretty stacked debut for Street Fighter 6 at the State of Play today. But it does seem like Street Fighter is taking some leaps with its next generation. The new challenger aims to arrive in 2023 for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\n",

Although the Wii version feels more like a five hour long playable <i>Ghostbusters<\/i> cartoon than anything else, that does not make it any less deserving of the franchise name.<\/p>\n<p>It gives off a lot of the same nostalgic vibes that its source material has for the past 20 years, with some great dialogue and a new storyline that could have been ripped directly from another movie sequel. There are lots of visits to familiar locations, and many of the faces to be seen are ones that we’ve all seen before, but because we have never had the opportunity to fight alongside the Ghostbusters before, it all feels somewhat new again. The AI behind the Ghostbuster crew isn’t the best ever, but they are pretty good about helping out with large crowds of enemies and not getting in the way. The game is separated into several small chunks of story, with a boss fight and a trip back to headquarters every three levels or so. This makes it all very easy to pick up and put down at one’s leisure.<\/p>\n<p><img title=\"Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, no job is too big, no fee is too big.\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/v1cdn.destructoid.com\/137687_g10-noscale.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"z\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The controls are as simple as simple gets. You move with the Nunchuk, aim with the Wiimote and press B to shoot. The D-pad scrolls through the three different weapons (Blast Stream, Slime Blower, Shock Blast) and the PKE Meter. Each of these has a secondary function that can be performed by pressing A. The learning curve needed to become a great Ghostbuster is not at all steep, which makes it easy for anyone to jump right in and play like they’ve been busting ghosts all their lives.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the best part of the game is that the whole thing can be played cooperatively. A friend can join you for some split screen action whenever you start a new game, continue a saved game, or go back to play a previous level. Running around, trapping ghosts and solving puzzles with your various guns is pretty fun, especially if you have a friend to do it with. In addition to helping each other out, you can slime one another and cross your streams (this, of course, results in instadeath) just for kicks. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t let the second player stray too far from the first, making it hard to split up and do more damage. on larger maps. Otherwise, the game is very well-tailored to fit in two players, with enough enemies and things to do for everyone. It even gives turns to each player when they are slamming around the same spook.<\/p>\n<p><img title=\"I had half a Slinky, but I straightened it.\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/v1cdn.destructoid.com\/137687_g6-noscale.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"dd\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While <i>Ghostbusters<\/i> is generally good times, the game does have its flaws. There were a few slight problems with the game’s otherwise great control scheme. As is usual with Wii games, these problems concern the few actions that are mapped to motion controls. I had some problems getting the game to register my flicking up and down. Left and right were quite a bit better, but the down motion is needed to get through some puzzles near the end of the game. My problems with getting the flicks to pick up made these portions a lot harder and frustrating than they needed to be, but thankfully, there were only one or two situations where this issue tested my patience.<\/p>\n<p>One very small issue with the gameplay itself is that there is never much of an incentive to use anything other than the Blast Stream in most combat situations, and the puzzles that do use the others aren’t terribly varied. For the better part of the game, I used the Blast Stream and its secondary, the Boson Dart. The latter weapon is a bit <i>too<\/i> powerful, knocking off a good chunk of health off of any enemy you may come across. I would have liked a little more variation in weapon usage both in and out of combat, if only to help keep the combat from growing stale.<\/p>\n<p>From the lowly (in regards to power) Slimer to the biggest specters, all of the ghosts in the game must be weakened, slammed around, and then roped into a standard ghost trap, thrown by a press of the Z button. Some enemies do need a little dousing in slime or dark matter to start off with, but the other weapons are never used for more than a few seconds before switching back to the old standby. There are a scant few cool puzzles using the other two guns, but they really could have done so many more neat things to integrate them better with the gameplay. The PKE Meter, on the other hand, is very intuitive and useful. When equipped, it simply leads you to the nearest supernatural activity. A press of the A button will equip you with PKE Goggles, enabling you to clearly see the paranormal goings-on around you. This can be a hidden ghost, items that can be interacted with, the weak points of a boss, and even invisible platforms that are poking into the real world through the Ghostworld.<\/p>\n<p><img title=\"&quot;This is a great plan! I'm excited to be a part of it!&quot;\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/v1cdn.destructoid.com\/137687_g11-noscale.jpg?resize=620%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"z\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The boss fights lend a big hand in keeping things interesting too. Sure they’re all dragged into a trap at the end, but the weakening process differs wonderfully from one to the other. In one boss fight, the player must shoot the boss’s projectiles back at it, and then rip out one of its many tongues with the capture stream while it is recuperating. In another, one can only hurt the boss by destroying the safety net under it and knocking it off the wall, causing it to hit the ground hard. Each one utilizes a different weapon as well. Most of the boss fights are a great reward for getting through an area, even more so if you find yourself getting tired of the same old song and dance on the way there.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest annoyance by far is the game’s collectibles, which are pages from Tobin’s Spirit Guide that are strewn all over each level. Every time you pick one of these pages up, regardless of whether or not you’re in the middle of a fight, the screen switches over to the Guide to show you what’s on the page you just found. There is no reason for this screen to pop up every time you get a new page when you can access the guide at any time from the pause menu. It jolts you out of the action for nothing. I eventually started to avoid collecting the pages altogether, as they aren’t much use other than for 100 percent completion.<\/p>\n<p><img title=\"&quot;The flowers are STILL standing!&quot;\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/v1cdn.destructoid.com\/137687_g2-noscale.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"z\" \/><\/p>\n<p>On the graphical side of things, there’s nothing too special here besides the nice, cartoony style of the characters (although the designs have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.truegameheadz.com\/blogheadz\/talented-character-designer-for-ghostbusters-wii-gets-the-shaft\/\" target=\"_blank\">questionable origins<\/a>). At best, the game looks like it belongs on the Playstation 2, and that’s really a shame, as much better can and has been done on the Wii. There is also some noticeable slowdown while fighting lots of respawning, flying enemies, which happens a few times near the end of the game. The score is taken straight from the movies, but isn’t too varied. On the other hand, the dialogue is humorous and the voice acting top notch (with the exception of Alyssa Milano’s work, which is rather uninspired). Some of the lines differ from what is spoken to the subtitles, assumedly to keep the game safely nestled in its E rating. There are enough references and familiar lines grouped with some great new quotes to make any fan delighted.<\/p>\n<p>The Wii version of <i>Ghostbusters: The Video Game<\/i> is by no means the perfect game, but it is a great movie-to-game adaptation, and a very fun and entertaining way to spend some time with some old friends if you’re a Wii-owning <i>Ghostbusters<\/i> lover. As this is a <i>very<\/i> character and story driven videogame, if you’re not a fan of the movies or the humor within them, you may not be as tolerant of the easy and somewhat repetitive gameplay as those who dig the characters and story might. The intuitive gameplay, interesting boss fights, and ability to co-op are plusses for all gamers, while the easy difficulty level and short game length are some of the negatives. It could be a buy for the biggest <i>Ghostbusters<\/i> fans, but I would definitely recommend this game as a rental first for most.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/the-official-destructoid-review-guide-ver-2-0-103621.phtml\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Score<\/b>:<\/a> <b>6 <\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Anthony Burch:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>As someone who played through the 360 version of <i>Ghostbusters<\/i> twice in the span of a week, I could not help but constantly compare the Wii version against it all throughout my single playthrough. In the end, one version felt more satisfying to me than the other — but not by <i>much<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>For every forward step the Wii version takes past its 360 counterpart, it unfortunately takes another step back. In the 360 version, for instance, the later levels included poorly designed, restart-heavy combat sections where you entire team might be slaughtered in an instant. The Wii version is much easier on normal difficulty and mitigates the frustration of constant, unfair death, but at the expense of becoming somewhat dull and redundant in the game’s latter missions. I truly can’t count how many times I’d walk into a room, only to have the doors forced shut by a magical force that refused to open them until I’d captured every single ghost in the room. The level design and progression structure are almost totally different from version to version: entire sections from the New York and Ghostworld levels have been totally excised from the Wii version, and many of the levels that both versions share have been significantly cut down for the Wii. In itself, this isn’t necessarily a good or bad thing (though I really, really miss the Super Trap level right before the Stay Puft fight); it’s just <i>different<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p><img title=\"&quot;There are many perks to being the mother of a living god.&quot;\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/v1cdn.destructoid.com\/137687_g3-620x.jpg?resize=620%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"erere\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Wii version’s <a href=\"https:\/\/traditionaldanimatio.deviantart.com\/gallery\/?2138218#Ghostbusters\" target=\"_blank\">poorly credited<\/a> art style not only effectively embraces the Wii’s technical limitations while still retaining an essential <i>Ghostbusters<\/i> feel, it also removes one of the most glaring faults with the 360 and PS3 versions — Bill Murray’s dialogue. When Peter Venkman looked like a regular dude, his over-the-top lines felt forced and irritating. When Peter Venkman looks like a cartoony version of his former self, his lines somehow work much better. A few Venkman quotes that originally made me roll my eyes actually elicited smirks this time around. The tradeoff for this is that the game’s cartoonified Ray Stantz more resembles a talking baked potato than Dan Aykroyd.<\/p>\n<p>It’s worth noting, though, that all of Venkman’s sexual innuendos — both of them — have been excised in order to keep an “E” rating. It’s all right, though, because there’s a lot of new and alternate dialogue in the Wii version you won’t find anywhere else, almost all of it good.<\/p>\n<p>The 360 version focused far more on combat, often to its detriment — by the halfway point, the game felt remarkably similar to any other 3rd-person shooter you could name. The Wii version, conversely, puts a much greater focus on the puzzles Ashley described above. Where the 360 version might only use a weapon like the Stasis Stream to make the process of bustin’ ghosts easier, the Wii version at one point had Davis and I running through a corridor  made of huge, turning gears that could only be traversed by well-timed blasts from our proton freeze ray. A couple of the puzzles are genuinely imaginative, and often more interesting than much of the repetitive combat that fills the 360 version’s latter half.<\/p>\n<p><img title=\"&quot;I looked at the trap, Ray.&quot;\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/v1cdn.destructoid.com\/137687_g4-620x.jpg?resize=620%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"ere\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It’s a good thing, too, because most of the combat in Wii <i>Ghostbusters<\/i> is tedious and unsatisfying. Don’t get me wrong, it feels <i>great<\/i> to tear up the environment with an IR sensor-controlled proton pack, and moderately satisfying to throw out a trap by holding down the Z button and swinging your arm forward. The main problem is that the simple process of bustin’ a ghost is nowhere near as compelling or well-paced as it is in the other versions of the game. After doing enough damage to an apparition with the proton pack, the ghost can be wrangled. In the 360 version, this means you can either start pressing the L trigger to slam him into walls and floors at your leisure until you feel like dragging him into the trap.<\/p>\n<p>In the Wii version, this means you have to play through a poorly paced, barely interactive game of simon says. A big red arrow appears on the ghost telling you to slam him to the right, so you flick your Wiimote to the right. Then, a short pause. Another red arrow shows up telling you to slam him in another direction, and if you don’t move the Wiimote in the correct way then nothing happens and the damage isn’t done. After you’ve finally whittled the ghost’s health down, you simply move it near the trap to automatically capture it. There’s no satisfying struggle to keep the ghost within the cone of light emanating from the trap as he slowly descends into it, like you get in the 360 version — he just runs into the trap and disappears.<\/p>\n<p>After a few hours of bustin’, I began to lament the sight of each new ghost. Having to wait for the game to tell me when I was <i>allowed<\/i> to slam a ghost felt so clunky and uninvolving that at one point, I actually groaned aloud when four ghosts sprang up out of nowhere. While some of the Wii levels are unquestionably better than the 360 ones — the Ghostworld boss is way better, and I actually exclaimed, “that’s awesome!” upon seeing the Wii version’s interpretation of the Spider Woman’s lair — a game called <i>Ghostbusters<\/i> should not, ideally, make me dread the actual act of <i>busting ghosts<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p><img title=\"&quot;Let's show this prehistoric bitch how we do things downtown.&quot;\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/v1cdn.destructoid.com\/137687_g5-620x.jpg?resize=620%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"e\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The co-op in <i>Ghostbusters <\/i>Wii is much more satisfying than the online play available on the other versions. Davis and I constantly crossed our streams for fun (try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light), and I took frequent sadistic pleasure in slowing her down with the slime gun whenever possible. Where multiplayer is concerned, both games are missing something that feels downright necessary; it’s up to you whether you value a local cooperative campaign more than online, plot-free multiplayer.<\/p>\n<p>If it weren’t for the unfortunate bustin’ mechanics, I would find it impossible to determine if <i>Ghostbusters <\/i>for the Wii was better or worse than the other, prettier versions that have been offered. The Wii version utilizes the alternate weapons in a more imaginative, consistent, and puzzle-centric way. It includes a fair amount of new, funny dialogue and one or two levels that irrefutably trump their 360 counterparts. In the end, though, the immensely satisfying act of wrangling a ghost into submission — that one gameplay mechanic the 360 and PS3 versions absolutely <i>nailed<\/i> — has been replaced with a tedious and disappointing Simon Says minigame repeated ad infinitum throughout the game’s five hour running time. The Wii version has a hell of a lot going for it, and I strongly recommend renting it if you either don’t own a PS3 or 360, or if you’re still hungry for a little more <i>Ghostbusters<\/i> action after finishing the other versions. It’s just a shame that, where the Wii version is concerned, bustin’ <i>didn’t<\/i> make me feel good.<\/p>\n<p>I swear to God, I won’t say that again for another six months.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/the-official-destructoid-review-guide-ver-2-0-103621.phtml\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Score<\/b>:<\/a> <b>5.5 <\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/the-official-destructoid-review-guide-ver-2-0-103621.phtml\">Final score:<\/a>  5.75 <\/b><b>— Mediocre<\/b> <i>(5s are an exercise in apathy, neither Solid nor Liquid.

There is no reason for this screen to pop up every time you get a new page when you can access the guide at any time from the pause menu. It jolts you out of the action for nothing. I eventually started to avoid collecting the pages altogether, as they aren’t much use other than for 100 percent completion.\n\nOn the graphical side of things, there’s nothing too special here besides the nice, cartoony style of the characters (although the designs have questionable origins). At best, the game looks like it belongs on the Playstation 2, and that’s really a shame, as much better can and has been done on the Wii. There is also some noticeable slowdown while fighting lots of respawning, flying enemies, which happens a few times near the end of the game. The score is taken straight from the movies, but isn’t too varied. On the other hand, the dialogue is humorous and the voice acting top notch (with the exception of Alyssa Milano’s work, which is rather uninspired). Some of the lines differ from what is spoken to the subtitles, assumedly to keep the game safely nestled in its E rating. There are enough references and familiar lines grouped with some great new quotes to make any fan delighted.\nThe Wii version of Ghostbusters: The Video Game is by no means the perfect game, but it is a great movie-to-game adaptation, and a very fun and entertaining way to spend some time with some old friends if you’re a Wii-owning Ghostbusters lover. As this is a very character and story driven videogame, if you’re not a fan of the movies or the humor within them, you may not be as tolerant of the easy and somewhat repetitive gameplay as those who dig the characters and story might. The intuitive gameplay, interesting boss fights, and ability to co-op are plusses for all gamers, while the easy difficulty level and short game length are some of the negatives. It could be a buy for the biggest Ghostbusters fans, but I would definitely recommend this game as a rental first for most.\nScore: 6 \nAnthony Burch:\nAs someone who played through the 360 version of Ghostbusters twice in the span of a week, I could not help but constantly compare the Wii version against it all throughout my single playthrough. In the end, one version felt more satisfying to me than the other — but not by much.\nFor every forward step the Wii version takes past its 360 counterpart, it unfortunately takes another step back. In the 360 version, for instance, the later levels included poorly designed, restart-heavy combat sections where you entire team might be slaughtered in an instant. The Wii version is much easier on normal difficulty and mitigates the frustration of constant, unfair death, but at the expense of becoming somewhat dull and redundant in the game’s latter missions. I truly can’t count how many times I’d walk into a room, only to have the doors forced shut by a magical force that refused to open them until I’d captured every single ghost in the room. The level design and progression structure are almost totally different from version to version: entire sections from the New York and Ghostworld levels have been totally excised from the Wii version, and many of the levels that both versions share have been significantly cut down for the Wii. In itself, this isn’t necessarily a good or bad thing (though I really, really miss the Super Trap level right before the Stay Puft fight); it’s just different.\n\nThe Wii version’s poorly credited art style not only effectively embraces the Wii’s technical limitations while still retaining an essential Ghostbusters feel, it also removes one of the most glaring faults with the 360 and PS3 versions — Bill Murray’s dialogue. When Peter Venkman looked like a regular dude, his over-the-top lines felt forced and irritating. When Peter Venkman looks like a cartoony version of his former self, his lines somehow work much better. A few Venkman quotes that originally made me roll my eyes actually elicited smirks this time around. The tradeoff for this is that the game’s cartoonified Ray Stantz more resembles a talking baked potato than Dan Aykroyd.\nIt’s worth noting, though, that all of Venkman’s sexual innuendos — both of them — have been excised in order to keep an “E” rating. It’s all right, though, because there’s a lot of new and alternate dialogue in the Wii version you won’t find anywhere else, almost all of it good.\nThe 360 version focused far more on combat, often to its detriment — by the halfway point, the game felt remarkably similar to any other 3rd-person shooter you could name. The Wii version, conversely, puts a much greater focus on the puzzles Ashley described above. Where the 360 version might only use a weapon like the Stasis Stream to make the process of bustin’ ghosts easier, the Wii version at one point had Davis and I running through a corridor  made of huge, turning gears that could only be traversed by well-timed blasts from our proton freeze ray. A couple of the puzzles are genuinely imaginative, and often more interesting than much of the repetitive combat that fills the 360 version’s latter half.\n\nIt’s a good thing, too, because most of the combat in Wii Ghostbusters is tedious and unsatisfying. Don’t get me wrong, it feels great to tear up the environment with an IR sensor-controlled proton pack, and moderately satisfying to throw out a trap by holding down the Z button and swinging your arm forward. The main problem is that the simple process of bustin’ a ghost is nowhere near as compelling or well-paced as it is in the other versions of the game. After doing enough damage to an apparition with the proton pack, the ghost can be wrangled. In the 360 version, this means you can either start pressing the L trigger to slam him into walls and floors at your leisure until you feel like dragging him into the trap.\nIn the Wii version, this means you have to play through a poorly paced, barely interactive game of simon says. A big red arrow appears on the ghost telling you to slam him to the right, so you flick your Wiimote to the right. Then, a short pause. Another red arrow shows up telling you to slam him in another direction, and if you don’t move the Wiimote in the correct way then nothing happens and the damage isn’t done. After you’ve finally whittled the ghost’s health down, you simply move it near the trap to automatically capture it. There’s no satisfying struggle to keep the ghost within the cone of light emanating from the trap as he slowly descends into it, like you get in the 360 version — he just runs into the trap and disappears.\nAfter a few hours of bustin’, I began to lament the sight of each new ghost. Having to wait for the game to tell me when I was allowed to slam a ghost felt so clunky and uninvolving that at one point, I actually groaned aloud when four ghosts sprang up out of nowhere. While some of the Wii levels are unquestionably better than the 360 ones — the Ghostworld boss is way better, and I actually exclaimed, “that’s awesome!” upon seeing the Wii version’s interpretation of the Spider Woman’s lair — a game called Ghostbusters should not, ideally, make me dread the actual act of busting ghosts.\n\nThe co-op in Ghostbusters Wii is much more satisfying than the online play available on the other versions. Davis and I constantly crossed our streams for fun (try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light), and I took frequent sadistic pleasure in slowing her down with the slime gun whenever possible. Where multiplayer is concerned, both games are missing something that feels downright necessary; it’s up to you whether you value a local cooperative campaign more than online, plot-free multiplayer.\nIf it weren’t for the unfortunate bustin’ mechanics, I would find it impossible to determine if Ghostbusters for the Wii was better or worse than the other, prettier versions that have been offered. The Wii version utilizes the alternate weapons in a more imaginative, consistent, and puzzle-centric way. It includes a fair amount of new, funny dialogue and one or two levels that irrefutably trump their 360 counterparts. In the end, though, the immensely satisfying act of wrangling a ghost into submission — that one gameplay mechanic the 360 and PS3 versions absolutely nailed — has been replaced with a tedious and disappointing Simon Says minigame repeated ad infinitum throughout the game’s five hour running time. The Wii version has a hell of a lot going for it, and I strongly recommend renting it if you either don’t own a PS3 or 360, or if you’re still hungry for a little more Ghostbusters action after finishing the other versions. It’s just a shame that, where the Wii version is concerned, bustin’ didn’t make me feel good.\nI swear to God, I won’t say that again for another six months.\nScore: 5.5 \nFinal score:  5.75 — Mediocre (5s are an exercise in apathy, neither Solid nor Liquid. Not exactly bad, but not very good either. Just a bit “meh,” really.)\n",

                "textplain": "\n\n\n \n\nThe long road ahead\nCD Projekt published a series of informational slides on Twitter today, alongside a YouTube video, outlining its future plans for the company and its brands, including The Witcher and Cyberpunk.\nAt the outset, CD Projekt says it plans to expand its online presence and build out both The Witcher and Cyberpunk franchises through “core gaming extensions” (like mobile) and partnerships, including TV series and merchandise. The publisher also says it plans to move into parallel AAA game development starting in 2022. The company has also invested in Digital Scrapes, a Vancouver-based studio that will bolster its other studios.\n\npic.twitter.com\/1AEja0sOI5\n— CD PROJEKT IR (@CDPROJEKTRED_IR) March 30, 2021\n“We are planning to build cross-functional teams to work on both IPs,” said Pawl Zawodny, Head of Production and CTO at CD Projekt, in one slide. “These teams will blend disciplines and expertise, so we have closer communication and skill sharing going on from the beginning. Cross-functional teams allow different aspects of development to run in tandem without complication.”\nAs for 2021, CD Projekt is planning on patches, updates, and free DLC for Cyberpunk 2077, alongside the forthcoming next-gen update. On The Witcher side, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will receive a next-gen update, Gwent will continue to receive development, and there’s also The Witcher: Monster Slayer in the pipeline.\nCD Projekt also seems to be responding to some of the critcisms surrounding the development and launch of Cyberpunk 2077. Reports of crunch circled around Cyberpunk 2077‘s launch, as did grievances over the state of the game at launch.\n\nIn the video update, CD Projekt highlighted further support for employees, including mental health. “We want to continuously improve the working environment for every team member,” said CD Projekt boss Adam KiciÅ„ski. “We want a sharper focus on how we work together to make great games.”\nExecutive Michal Nowakowski also said that the company has learned from its marketing and PR campaigns for Cyberpunk 2077. “Going forward, our campaigns will be much shorter,” said Nowakowski. “We will wait until much closer to a game’s launch before we start showing things like trailers, demos, or going in-depth about mechanics, etc.”\nWhether all of this can right the ship after the still-lingering backlash over Cyberpunk 2077, it certainly looks like CD Projekt is forging ahead either way. Hopefully a pause and reassessment can curtail some of the reported issues at the company. \n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tPC port joins console editions\nGood news for PC shmuppers today, as City Connection has announced that Cave shmup Akai Katana Shin will be arriving on Steam on December 15, in alignment with its previously announced re-release on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.\nAs we have previously reported, Akai Katana Shin originally launched on Xbox 360 in 2011, itself a remaster of Cave’s great 2010 arcade release. In typical Cave fashion the dazzling shmup features adrenaline-pumping, bullet-hell action, a beat-heavy soundtrack, and a melodramatic storyline that features a put-upon people, sick of being sacrificed to the titular totem, rising up against their oppressors in a bid for freedom.\nCheck out a preview of the re-release from April’s FES 2022 stream. The action starts at 33:30.\n\nThe new release will feature high-resolution visuals, a widescreen presentation format, and three individual modes to please both Akai Katana veterans and newcomers. Akai Katana Origin will replicate the 2010 arcade in all of its 4:3 glory, Akai Katana Slash will feature revised enemy patterns, new mechanics, and the aforementioned 16:9 screen ratio, while Akai Katana Climax will feature a blend of the previous modes, readjusted for balance. City Connection has noted that Akai Katana Shin will support multiple languages, including English, French, and Spanish.\nAkai Katana Shin launches December 15 on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. A physical release will follow in 2023 on PS4 and Nintendo Switch only.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChris Moyse\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

                "textplain": "\nThe “winter” window has been narrowed down\nSeveral months ago, Nintendo teased a trio of Splatoon 3 amiibo (Octoling Blue, Inkling Yellow, and Smallfry) arriving “this holiday.” Well thanks to a new YouTube video, the release date has been narrowed down to November 11.\nRoughly the first minute of the video is a recap of everything we covered here: including basic amiibo functionality. But in the remaining 20 seconds or so there’s a release date announcement, plus a brief look at what costumes the upcoming amiibo will grant players. Reprints of several old Splatoon amiibo (including Pearl and Marina) are coming around the same time, so keep an eye out for those as well.\nKeep in mind that as of late, amiibo haven’t been as super rare as they have been in the past. While old school amiibo hunters are always ready for an instant-sell-out situation, stock has generally been plentiful: so hopefully that will be the case for these figures too.\nOnce these three are released in November, we’ll have the following announced amiibo remaining:\nSuper Smash Bros.

The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/18\/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california\/?guccounter=1\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch Disrupt.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news\/\" target=\"_blank\">left the publisher in the fall of 2021<\/a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service.

                "textplain": "\n\n\n \n\n‘There’s no real equivalent [to this series] at this moment’\nIt’s been almost a decade since Test Drive Unlimited 2, but the island racing series is coming back with a new game in production at KT Racing Studio and Nacon called Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown.\n\nThe game’s appearance during today’s Nacon Connect stream didn’t divulge gameplay footage (it’s vague teasers, for the time being), but creative director Alain Jarniou, a developer on the prior TDU games, shared some insights. The international racing championship concept is back for Solar Crown (hence that name), and the team intends for players to have the “freedom to progress” how they want.\nKT Racing is striving to keep the “DNA” of Test Drive Unlimited going strong while also “evolving the gameplay and game modes to make them more modern.” (A tricky balancing act, to be sure.) “We wanted to relaunch this great franchise because there’s no real equivalent at this moment.”\nHe spoke about gravel, asphalt, “lots of customization options” for player avatars, and recreating an island at a 1:1 scale for the sake of “authenticity,” but there isn’t a date or even a release window.\nBugatti, Ferrari, Dodge, Koenigsegg, and Porsche are some of the confirmed names so far.\nThis one seems pretty far off. Any guesses on which island they’ll recreate?\n\n \n\nJordan is a founding member of Destructoid and poster of seemingly random pictures. They are anything but random.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tOverwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs\nNetflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.\nThe new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.\n\nIn addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.\nThe newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie.

This is excellent news for me, considering it’s one of my favorite genres ever, and you can bet your bottom dollar I’m playing as many of them as I can.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/ooblet-run.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" alt \/><\/p>\n<h3>Why was <em>Stardew<\/em> so popular?<\/h3>\n<p>While farming\/community sims have been around for a long, long time, I think we can accredit a lot of their recent resurgence to the success of one stellar indie game: <i>Stardew Valley<\/i>. It’s one of those games that’s simple enough to pick up and start playing regardless of your skill level and even regardless of where you are in any given save file, yet still complex enough for players to challenge themselves and min-max the crap out of it if they want to.<\/p>\n<p>The controls are simple and you can run it on anything, which means it’s available (as well as affordably priced) on every conceivable platform. The game has fostered a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/stardew-valley-mods-list-make-the-game-feel-fresh-again\/\" target=\"_blank\">rich modding community<\/a>, who enjoy putting a fresh spin on the gameplay, story, characters, aesthetics, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, it’s the passion project of a single developer, and has all of the charm and care you might expect from someone who truly loves what they’re making. All of these elements came together to not just create an unforgettable game, but a full-on cultural phenomenon that swept through the industry and made <i>Stardew<\/i> one of the most beloved and successful indie games of all time.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Stardew-Valley-mods-screenshot.jpg?resize=640%2C406&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Stardew Valley update 1.6 will help modders\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Cause and effect<\/h3>\n<p>If my hypothesis is correct, that means that now over six years after its release, we are seeing <i>Stardew Valley<\/i>’s influence ripple through the industry — hence the wave of cozy farming\/community simulators. Of course, we have to give credit where it’s due to series like <i>Animal Crossing<\/i> and <i>Harvest Moon\/Story of Seasons <\/i>for paving the way for this once niche genre to break further into the mainstream, but I truly believe <i>Stardew<\/i> is what pushed it over the edge due to its universal appeal and subsequent popularity.<\/p>\n<p>So now we have a wave of all kinds of games that are putting their own spin on the classic farming\/community sim formula, which is a ton of fun to see. Just like shooters or RPGs take the mechanical motifs of their genre and try to do something no one has quite seen before down to the most minute level, simulators are seeing the same level of impassioned scrutiny.<\/p>\n<p>Video games are still an incredibly young medium compared to film, television, literature, or even their older cousin, tabletop games. As someone who has studied patterns and whole movements that form in media, I can’t express how cool it is to see developers explore the intricacies of a newer genre and create something new.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/PREVIEW_SCREENSHOT1_145752.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"One of the original faming simulators\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Carving a new path<\/h3>\n<p>So for example, most of these games are going to have mechanics like farming, mining, fishing, cooking, crafting, befriending townspeople, etc., but the combination in how these mechanics are implemented and influence each other will always be unique. Each game will have different economic and social systems for the player to interact with that will lead to different outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>It’s like how a lot of games like <i>BioShock<\/i>, <i>Mass Effect<\/i>, and <i>Dishonored<\/i>, for example, have some kind of magic mechanic to supplement weapons that we know and recognize, like guns, daggers, etc. While we’re familiar with the motif of magic supplementing familiar weapons, each game that implements its own kind of magic will use that magic slightly differently — what the magic can do will be different, the cost of that magic will be different (usually utilizing some kind of mana system, which can also have an infinite number of variations), and so on. There are a lot of layers here.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/CultoftheLamb_NextFest_061422.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" alt \/><\/p>\n<p>My point is, we have enough farming simulators now that by nature of a saturated (and nearly oversaturated) market, developers are forced to think creatively when it comes to using the mechanics in the toolbox of their genre to create as engaging of an experience as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Then we get games like <i>Cult of the Lamb<\/i> or <i>Ooblets<\/i>, which combine community simulation with an action roguelike and farming simulation with <em>Pokémon<\/em>-style animal companion battling, respectively. Like storytelling, the key to making fresh and exciting games is finding new ways to combine and implement elements we already love.<\/p>\n<p>It’s one thing to study that phenomenon in retrospect, but it’s another to see it happen in real time. Regardless of what some people say, I think this is a very, very exciting time for games — especially farming simulators.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

All of these elements came together to not just create an unforgettable game, but a full-on cultural phenomenon that swept through the industry and made Stardew one of the most beloved and successful indie games of all time.\n\nCause and effect\nIf my hypothesis is correct, that means that now over six years after its release, we are seeing Stardew Valley’s influence ripple through the industry — hence the wave of cozy farming\/community simulators. Of course, we have to give credit where it’s due to series like Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon\/Story of Seasons for paving the way for this once niche genre to break further into the mainstream, but I truly believe Stardew is what pushed it over the edge due to its universal appeal and subsequent popularity.\nSo now we have a wave of all kinds of games that are putting their own spin on the classic farming\/community sim formula, which is a ton of fun to see. Just like shooters or RPGs take the mechanical motifs of their genre and try to do something no one has quite seen before down to the most minute level, simulators are seeing the same level of impassioned scrutiny.\nVideo games are still an incredibly young medium compared to film, television, literature, or even their older cousin, tabletop games. As someone who has studied patterns and whole movements that form in media, I can’t express how cool it is to see developers explore the intricacies of a newer genre and create something new.\n\nCarving a new path\nSo for example, most of these games are going to have mechanics like farming, mining, fishing, cooking, crafting, befriending townspeople, etc., but the combination in how these mechanics are implemented and influence each other will always be unique. Each game will have different economic and social systems for the player to interact with that will lead to different outcomes.\nIt’s like how a lot of games like BioShock, Mass Effect, and Dishonored, for example, have some kind of magic mechanic to supplement weapons that we know and recognize, like guns, daggers, etc. While we’re familiar with the motif of magic supplementing familiar weapons, each game that implements its own kind of magic will use that magic slightly differently — what the magic can do will be different, the cost of that magic will be different (usually utilizing some kind of mana system, which can also have an infinite number of variations), and so on. There are a lot of layers here.\n\nMy point is, we have enough farming simulators now that by nature of a saturated (and nearly oversaturated) market, developers are forced to think creatively when it comes to using the mechanics in the toolbox of their genre to create as engaging of an experience as possible.\nThen we get games like Cult of the Lamb or Ooblets, which combine community simulation with an action roguelike and farming simulation with Pokémon-style animal companion battling, respectively. Like storytelling, the key to making fresh and exciting games is finding new ways to combine and implement elements we already love.\nIt’s one thing to study that phenomenon in retrospect, but it’s another to see it happen in real time. Regardless of what some people say, I think this is a very, very exciting time for games — especially farming simulators.\n",

                "textplain": "\nWorld of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King Classic launches globally today and Destructoid sister site Icy Veins is here to tell you all about it, including an assortment of guides.\nGlobal Release Times\nWrath Classic launches in the Americas, Europe, Taiwan, Korea, and Australia\/New Zealand simultaneously. Check the details below for the exact time you can log in to the game and explore all that the new expansion has to offer.\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nNew Continent: Northrend – Heroes will begin their journey in one of two zones in Northrend — Borean Tundra or Howling Fjord. A vast new continent awaits!\nNew Hero Class: Death Knights – Available to both factions at Level 55, Death Knights harness the powers of darkness to help combat the evil that threatens Azeroth. In Wrath Classic, Blizard is bypassing the requirement for a player’s first Death Knight character, unless they decide to pick a fresh realm.\nNew Profession: Inscription – Scribe mystical glyphs that modify the properties of spells and abilities or create powerful trinkets and off-hand items.\nAchievements – Show off your accomplishments and earn various rewards in WoW Classic!\nDungeons &amp; Raids – Multiple new dungeons and 3 raids will be available during Phase 1.\n\nWrath of the Lich King Classic is included with existing World of Warcraft subscriptions. If you subscribe to World of Warcraft, you can also play Wrath of the Lich King Classic at no additional cost.\n\nNew Hero Class: Death Knight\nDeath Knights are a new Hero Class available in Wrath Classic. They start at Level 55 in Ebon Hold and have 3 specializations to choose from: Blood, Frost, and Unholy. You do not need an existing Level 55 character on the same realm to create your first Death Knight in Wrath Classic. Fresh start realms are an exception to the rule. Any Death Knight created after your first one must be on a different realm, and requires an existing Level 55 character on the same realm. Completing the Death Knight intro in Wrath Classic rewards the Frostbrood Proto-Wyrm mount on live servers.\nIf you’re playing a Death Knight in Wrath Classic, we have a set of guides specifically tailored to help you with leveling, gearing, talents, addons, and macros.\nDeath Knight PvE &amp; PvP Guides\nDeath Knight Gear Guides\nTalent Guides\nInscription is a new Profession that lets you craft powerful items called glyphs that enhance spells and abilities. Scribes can create various trinkets and off-hand items.\n\n\nWe’ve all been there! It is always difficult to choose a class, especially in an MMORPG like World of Warcraft, and when you finally decide which class to play, it’s time to start leveling! The cap has been raised to Level 80 in Wrath Classic (up from Level 70 in Burning Crusade Classic).\nIf you do not plan on maining a Death Knight, we have leveling guides for other classes as well with recommended builds and talents.\nDruid Leveling Guides\n\nDruid Leveling Guide\nBalance Druid Leveling Guide\nFeral DPS Druid Leveling Guide\nFeral Tank Druid Leveling Guide\nRestoration Druid Leveling Guide\n\nHunter Leveling Guides\n\nHunter Leveling Guide\nBeast Mastery Hunter Leveling Guide\nMarksmanship Hunter Leveling Guide\nSurvival Hunter Leveling Guide\n\nMage Leveling Guides\n\nMage Leveling Guide\nArcane Mage Leveling Guide\nFire Mage Leveling Guide\nFrost Mage ST Leveling Guide\nFrost Mage AoE Leveling Guide\n\n\nPaladin Leveling Guides\n\nPaladin Leveling Guide\nHoly Paladin Leveling Guide\nProtection Paladin Leveling Guide\nRetribution Paladin Leveling Guide\n\nPriest Leveling Guides\n\nPriest Leveling Guide\nDiscipline Priest Leveling Guide\nHoly Priest Leveling Guide\nShadow Priest Leveling Guide\n\nRogue Leveling Guides\n\nRogue Leveling Guide\nAssassination Rogue Leveling Guide\nCombat Rogue Leveling Guide\nSubtlety Rogue Leveling Guide\n\nShaman Leveling Guides\n\nShaman Leveling Guide\nElemental Shaman Leveling Guide\nEnhancement Shaman Leveling Guide\nRestoration Shaman Leveling Guide\n\nWarlock Leveling Guides\nAs of the time of writing this article, Warlock guides are in the process of being deployed on the site.

Originally slated for September 2022, Nintendo is now targeting a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 July 29 launch.\nThe news was shared this morning directly from Nintendo, who gave us a new trailer that showcases “more about the game’s story, characters, and strategic battle system, where you can team up with up to seven characters.” We’ll evidently be put into the role of controlling “Noah and Mio,” as they deal with a conflict between the nations of Agnus and Keves: part of Aionios.\nNintendo is really stressing the “seven characters” thing, noting that each party member will have a unique battle role in “Noah’s party of six.” You’ll also be able to meet “additional characters,” hinting that the overall party, active and non-active, will be larger than prior games in the series, and many modern RPGs as a whole.\nNoah is described as a close-range sword wielder, while Mio is a Zephyr, who excels in dodging\/evasion and “drawing enemy attention.” You can also swap classes to create your own builds, and party members can “combine if certain conditions are met” to transform into a giant Ouroboros form: par for the course for super attacks in JRPGs.\nWe also got a taste of the Special Edition of the game, which will launch at a later undisclosed date “exclusively on the My Nintendo store.” It’ll include a special box (with art by Masatsugu Saito), the game itself, a steelbook, and an art book (that Nintendo says has “250+ full color pages”).\nAs usual, the Xenoblade series is getting a stylish launch!\nXenoblade Chronicles 3 July special edition:\n\nTake a look at the #XenobladeChronicles3 Special Edition, which will launch exclusively on the My Nintendo Store!\nStay tuned for more info on when pre-orders will open. pic.twitter.com\/BJ8uIo19vI\n— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) April 19, 2022\n\n\n \n\nReviews Director, Co-EIC - Chris has been enjoying Destructoid avidly since 2008.

As the savior with a magic touch, it’s up to you to clear the night thorns and restore the town to its former glory, while wrangling together the Disney characters who used to call it home. You’ll do this by farming, fishing, crafting, cooking, mining, digging, and helping your new Disney BFFs with their requests.<\/p>\n<p>On paper, I can see how that sounds like <em>Animal Crossing<\/em>, <em>Stardew Valley<\/em>, or <em>Story of Seasons<\/em>.

You’re not just here to make friends and relax in a laid-back lifestyle, you’re here to complete the various story and friendship quest lines that help build toward the overall goal of restoring the town. Completing these quests, as well as performing just about every action you can in the game, will earn you “Dreamlight”. With this, you’ll be able to open up new areas of the valley and access the different Disney realms where new town inhabitants can be found.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/9PpoGfIeAO0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>Let’s Get Together<\/h2>\n<p>Just a few of the realms are available right now, covering <em>Ratatouille<\/em>, <em>Moana<\/em>, <em>Frozen<\/em>, and <em>Wall-E<\/em>. Don’t expect anything too extensive with these realms. They’re not like the worlds you explore in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/reviews\/review-disney-magical-world-2\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Disney Magical World<\/em><\/a> games on the Nintendo 3DS. The realms here so far are just small themed areas where you’ll find a character or two asking you for help with a problem. For <em>Ratatouille<\/em>, Remy needs your help in the kitchen. For <em>Wall-E<\/em>, it’s all about trash and plants. Complete their requests, which you should be able to do in a matter of minutes, and they’ll agree to come live in your town.<\/p>\n<p>Other characters join the fun as you unlock more of the valley. Initially, it’s just Merlin, Mickey Mouse, and Scrooge McDuck, the latter of whom has the most comically inconsistent voice acting I’ve heard in quite some time. It doesn’t take long for Goofy to appear, and within a few hours, most players should be helping out Ursula too. Add in Mother Gothel, who somehow made the cut for early inclusion, and it’s clear to see that, at least for these opening hours and Early Access period, Gameloft is leaning toward Disney’s more recent history in building its collection of characters. More are on the way, and I suspect as a games-as-a-service title, we’ll see them added with high-profile updates over the next few months and years.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully, those updates will come with more than just new characters because I’d really like to see more of Disney’s past injected into this game. Outside of the familiar faces, <em>Dreamlight Valley<\/em> is a largely unremarkable fantasy world that doesn’t share a connection to any particular Disney product. Had this game taken place in a more recognizable location, like Main Street U.S.A., it might feel more sufficiently “Disney” than it does right now. As a lifelong fan of this evil corporation, I appreciate what references have made it so far. Never did I think, in the year 2022, I would hear a character whistling part of the song from the Splash Mountain ride, but here we are.<\/p>\n<p>It would just be nice to see Gameloft go a bit deeper into the Disney catalog as it continues to develop and update this game. For instance, the soundtrack went dead silent when the rain started to fall in the valley. With Disney having a few pieces of music associated with rain—the score to <em>The Old Mill<\/em>, “The Rain, Rain, Rain Came Down, Down, Down,” and “Little April Shower,” to name a few—it illustrated just how much more history the developers could be pulling from.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Disney-Dreamlight-Valley_20220905112004.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Ratatouille\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Heigh-Ho<\/h2>\n<p>Of course, all the Disney references in the world won’t matter if people tire too quickly of the gameplay loop. I’ve been obsessed with this game for the past few days, but I’ve also reached a point where I can see a progression wall on the horizon. Some characters are making requests for items I don’t have access to yet, and costs for entering realms and building character dwellings are rising. Character questlines are also becoming increasingly complicated, often dependent on how far I’ve progressed with other characters around town. Add in long wait times for crops to sprout and Dreamlight being earned at a slower pace, and it’s clear I’ve reached the point in a free-to-play game where I’m really going to have to start putting in the time or potentially putting in the money.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of money, <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley<\/em> has a battle pass-inspired “Star Path” where completing certain tasks will earn you credits you can use to buy limited-time items. The game is currently hosting a Pixar Fest Star Path, which has a variety of Pixar-themed rewards to earn. Like with most battle passes, there is a free and paid track, the latter of which requires “Moonstones”, the game’s paid currency. There doesn’t appear to be any way to purchase Moonstones in Early Access, but if you buy into the game right now with any of the Founder’s Packs, you’ll be given enough to cover the cost of a few of the Star Paths depending on which edition you spring for.<\/p>\n<p>The cost of the paid track for the Pixar Fest Star Path is 2,500 Moonstones. While you will earn more Moonstones if you purchase the paid track it looks as though, at least for this Star Path event, you can only earn 2,175 of them, which likely won’t be enough to cover the cost of the next featured Star Path.<\/p>\n<p>Like with earning Dreamlight, completing tasks for the Star Path will require a lot of repetition. Cook this many meals, pick this many fruits, sell this many items, etc. Obviously, this ties into <em>Dreamlight Valley<\/em>’s gameplay loop, but I do wonder if such a system could lead to faster player burnout. How many times are players going to be up for picking 100 fruits or collecting 10,000 coins before they get bored of it? It’s one thing to offer these activities as optional or spread out over the life of the game. It’s another thing to tie these types of tasks to temporary events and fleeting rewards.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/Disney-Dreamlight-Valley_20220905152258.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Disney Pixar Wall-E\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Oo-De-Lally<\/h2>\n<p>But such is the nature of a free-to-play game. It may look like something designed with the console crowd in mind, but at its core, it’s no different than what Gameloft did with <em>Disney Magic Kingdoms<\/em>. The only difference is this is a much more engaging experience. If you do decide to jump into <em>Dreamlight Valley<\/em> during its Early Access period, know that I did encounter a few issues that did encumber my progression for a few hours, including ridiculously scarce seaweed–a <em>vital<\/em> crafting ingredient–and little woodland creatures that refused to stop so I could feed them.<\/p>\n<p>In a way, <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley<\/em> is a wish come true for me. I’ve always wanted a wholesome game where I could share a fully realized world with the Disney characters I grew up with. And while I’m sure those characters will be added to the game eventually, what’s here is enough to satisfy the 10-year-old inside my soul who’s eating a Mickey Mouse waffle at Goofy’s Kitchen while getting an autograph from some criminally underpaid guy in a Pluto costume.<\/p>\n<p><em>Disney Dreamlight Valley<\/em> is available now in paid Early Access for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. It is also part of Xbox Game Pass. It will launch as a free-to-play title on all platforms and mobile next year.<\/p>\n<p><sub>[This scoreless review is based on an Early Access build of the game provided by the publisher.]<\/sub><\/p>\n<\/div>",

Completing these quests, as well as performing just about every action you can in the game, will earn you “Dreamlight”. With this, you’ll be able to open up new areas of the valley and access the different Disney realms where new town inhabitants can be found.\n\nLet’s Get Together\nJust a few of the realms are available right now, covering Ratatouille, Moana, Frozen, and Wall-E. Don’t expect anything too extensive with these realms. They’re not like the worlds you explore in the Disney Magical World games on the Nintendo 3DS. The realms here so far are just small themed areas where you’ll find a character or two asking you for help with a problem. For Ratatouille, Remy needs your help in the kitchen. For Wall-E, it’s all about trash and plants. Complete their requests, which you should be able to do in a matter of minutes, and they’ll agree to come live in your town.\nOther characters join the fun as you unlock more of the valley. Initially, it’s just Merlin, Mickey Mouse, and Scrooge McDuck, the latter of whom has the most comically inconsistent voice acting I’ve heard in quite some time. It doesn’t take long for Goofy to appear, and within a few hours, most players should be helping out Ursula too. Add in Mother Gothel, who somehow made the cut for early inclusion, and it’s clear to see that, at least for these opening hours and Early Access period, Gameloft is leaning toward Disney’s more recent history in building its collection of characters. More are on the way, and I suspect as a games-as-a-service title, we’ll see them added with high-profile updates over the next few months and years.\nHopefully, those updates will come with more than just new characters because I’d really like to see more of Disney’s past injected into this game. Outside of the familiar faces, Dreamlight Valley is a largely unremarkable fantasy world that doesn’t share a connection to any particular Disney product. Had this game taken place in a more recognizable location, like Main Street U.S.A., it might feel more sufficiently “Disney” than it does right now. As a lifelong fan of this evil corporation, I appreciate what references have made it so far. Never did I think, in the year 2022, I would hear a character whistling part of the song from the Splash Mountain ride, but here we are.\nIt would just be nice to see Gameloft go a bit deeper into the Disney catalog as it continues to develop and update this game. For instance, the soundtrack went dead silent when the rain started to fall in the valley. With Disney having a few pieces of music associated with rain—the score to The Old Mill, “The Rain, Rain, Rain Came Down, Down, Down,” and “Little April Shower,” to name a few—it illustrated just how much more history the developers could be pulling from.\n\nHeigh-Ho\nOf course, all the Disney references in the world won’t matter if people tire too quickly of the gameplay loop. I’ve been obsessed with this game for the past few days, but I’ve also reached a point where I can see a progression wall on the horizon. Some characters are making requests for items I don’t have access to yet, and costs for entering realms and building character dwellings are rising. Character questlines are also becoming increasingly complicated, often dependent on how far I’ve progressed with other characters around town. Add in long wait times for crops to sprout and Dreamlight being earned at a slower pace, and it’s clear I’ve reached the point in a free-to-play game where I’m really going to have to start putting in the time or potentially putting in the money.\nIn terms of money, Disney Dreamlight Valley has a battle pass-inspired “Star Path” where completing certain tasks will earn you credits you can use to buy limited-time items. The game is currently hosting a Pixar Fest Star Path, which has a variety of Pixar-themed rewards to earn. Like with most battle passes, there is a free and paid track, the latter of which requires “Moonstones”, the game’s paid currency. There doesn’t appear to be any way to purchase Moonstones in Early Access, but if you buy into the game right now with any of the Founder’s Packs, you’ll be given enough to cover the cost of a few of the Star Paths depending on which edition you spring for.\nThe cost of the paid track for the Pixar Fest Star Path is 2,500 Moonstones. While you will earn more Moonstones if you purchase the paid track it looks as though, at least for this Star Path event, you can only earn 2,175 of them, which likely won’t be enough to cover the cost of the next featured Star Path.\nLike with earning Dreamlight, completing tasks for the Star Path will require a lot of repetition. Cook this many meals, pick this many fruits, sell this many items, etc. Obviously, this ties into Dreamlight Valley’s gameplay loop, but I do wonder if such a system could lead to faster player burnout. How many times are players going to be up for picking 100 fruits or collecting 10,000 coins before they get bored of it? It’s one thing to offer these activities as optional or spread out over the life of the game. It’s another thing to tie these types of tasks to temporary events and fleeting rewards.\n\nOo-De-Lally\nBut such is the nature of a free-to-play game. It may look like something designed with the console crowd in mind, but at its core, it’s no different than what Gameloft did with Disney Magic Kingdoms. The only difference is this is a much more engaging experience. If you do decide to jump into Dreamlight Valley during its Early Access period, know that I did encounter a few issues that did encumber my progression for a few hours, including ridiculously scarce seaweed–a vital crafting ingredient–and little woodland creatures that refused to stop so I could feed them.\nIn a way, Disney Dreamlight Valley is a wish come true for me. I’ve always wanted a wholesome game where I could share a fully realized world with the Disney characters I grew up with. And while I’m sure those characters will be added to the game eventually, what’s here is enough to satisfy the 10-year-old inside my soul who’s eating a Mickey Mouse waffle at Goofy’s Kitchen while getting an autograph from some criminally underpaid guy in a Pluto costume.\nDisney Dreamlight Valley is available now in paid Early Access for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. It is also part of Xbox Game Pass. It will launch as a free-to-play title on all platforms and mobile next year.\n[This scoreless review is based on an Early Access build of the game provided by the publisher.]\n",

We get that this concept is upsetting to people who think that journalists should be locked in ivory towers like princesses, but we do have to leave the house and have solid, sometimes boozy awkward human relationships to do this type of work. That said, we make every effort to have people review games who were nowhere near said events so we can continue to have enjoyable jobs with party perks, because the Lord and our banker knows we’re definitely not doing this for the money.<\/p>\n<p>But seriously, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/ethics-statement-280654.phtml\">we really care about transparency<\/a> because we get the whole distrust in media thing. We investigated the magazines and websites that came before us, and so we understand that you should rightfully be investigating us. Go at it! We welcome it and we think we do it better than anyone else — I don’t think you’ll find another media publication who completely outsources ad sales and has a wholly independent editorial team who gives 3 fucks about who buys ads, and we prefer to be member-supported anyway (which is coming very soon!). Pissing excellence.<\/p>\n<p>Regarding press events and “junkets”: We’d be happy to attend your event, but <b>we will never deliver a review on the spot at your event – forget about it, please don’t ask, end of story<\/b>. Our readers want us testing stuff in our homes on the same type of equipment they would use, not a controlled environment or after doing shots with Jay-Z.

If you want to be a huge dick about it we’re going to have a lot of fun at your expense.\n\nContests and Community\nFAQ: Who owns your community blog?\nYou do, of course! You own all of your community blogs and posts, and Destructoid licenses them under: creative commons with attribution. We make nightly on-site and off-site backups, but in the case of a nuclear meltdown please make your own local backups so you can sleep better.\nWant to give something away, or did you win something in a contest and never get notified? Please get in touch with our community team\n\nContent takedowns\nJust shoot us an informal email and we’ll take it down as soon as humanly possible. We take intellectual property concerns very seriously – but please understand that there is a metric f–kton of community uploading going on and we can’t catch everything. If you send us a letter from your lawyer a fluffy kitten will get diarrhea somewhere and it will be on you, man.\nIf you spammed our site and Google is now penalizing your SEO and want us to take that link down … NOPE! Enjoy your Google penalty forever. No seriously, we will never remove it and we don’t want your takedown money. That’s karma, buddy! Try not sucking in your next life.\nIf your real name appears on the site \/ you’re cleaning up your social footprint why not completely change the identity on all your posts instead?\nFor all other stuff, just shoot an email from the address on the account over to community team. You must be able to reply from that account to remove content.\n\nLegacy Ad-Free \/ Huge Subscriptions\nSorry, we don’t offer this service anymore. If you’re grandfathered in, good for you. For ad-free memberships (like a subscription from something that used to be called TinyPass) but is now owned by Piano. It’s the same company. We do not have access to this system and can’t cancel it for you. However, you can do it yourself. Try searching your inbox for the receipt. That will tell you what email is associated with your account. Then try logging in (or doing a forgot password on piano.io) and create an inquiry to get a refund asap.\nIf you paid with Paypal and didn’t get auto-renewed, login to Tinypass and click on “My History” to see why. They only try your account once, so if it failed for whatever reason you’ll have to sign-up again from scratch.\n\nGeneral Support\nDid someone do something naughty, like spam or ugly comments? Does a feature of the site not work? Reach us directly at Support Line. Please make sure you read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Common Sense.\n\nSite Bugs\nGet in touch at support@destructoid.com. In many cases the bug can be to your specific device \/ browser \/ browser extensions \/ antivirus, so please provide as much information about your computing environment to expedite the fix. Please include screenshots, urls, etc if possible. If you have a query about advertising-related problems, please let us know where you are geolocated, as that helps us track down and block the offending supplier. We generally don’t do ads in-house.\n\nAdvertising\nDestructoid does not accept any in-house direct advertising, we don’t accept sponsored articles, we will not let you buy a text link, and if you’re even remotely associated with gambling don’t even waste your time, we’ll block you. All ads must be purchased through third parties. Church and state!\nWhere to buy ads: Please contact Enthusiast Gaming\n\nJobs at our publications\nWe’re always looking for talented people that understand that this is a job where you write daily. If you don’t write daily, or the thought of doing that sounds annoying, then this gig is not for you. This job is for lovers.\nPlease send us your writing samples. Show us that you can argue with clarity. No games journalism experience necessary, we’ll train you. Send us links to your personal blog or published works at: gigs@enthusiastgaming.com.\n\nI want to contact a specific editor to do a thing\nPlease understand that Destructoid functions like a wasp vortex. Every story is scheduled in advanced and out in the open — whatever you tell one person is going to end up going through a rigorous proofing and approvals process anyway, so why not just email everybody instead and save us the time?\n\nProduct reviews and Junkets\nPlease DO send press releases and products to our contact email. Do mail review copies to the address above. Anything sent with a return postage will be promptly sent back after review, otherwise we’ll assume it becomes niece property by way of cool bro-aunties.\nOtherwise … don’t contact us, we’ll contact you: it’s in everyone’s best interest that our staff chooses the products we think will best interest our readers ( for these reasons )\n\nEthics, Parties, and Acquaintances\nAndrew WK disclosure: Destructoid parties hard with the video game industry. We get that this concept is upsetting to people who think that journalists should be locked in ivory towers like princesses, but we do have to leave the house and have solid, sometimes boozy awkward human relationships to do this type of work. That said, we make every effort to have people review games who were nowhere near said events so we can continue to have enjoyable jobs with party perks, because the Lord and our banker knows we’re definitely not doing this for the money.\nBut seriously, we really care about transparency because we get the whole distrust in media thing. We investigated the magazines and websites that came before us, and so we understand that you should rightfully be investigating us. Go at it! We welcome it and we think we do it better than anyone else — I don’t think you’ll find another media publication who completely outsources ad sales and has a wholly independent editorial team who gives 3 fucks about who buys ads, and we prefer to be member-supported anyway (which is coming very soon!). Pissing excellence.\nRegarding press events and “junkets”: We’d be happy to attend your event, but we will never deliver a review on the spot at your event – forget about it, please don’t ask, end of story. Our readers want us testing stuff in our homes on the same type of equipment they would use, not a controlled environment or after doing shots with Jay-Z. We hope that alleviates future awkward conversations.\n\nHigh res logos and press\nHere’s a giant Destructoid logo for your convenience.\n\n\nContact the Founder\nYou can reach Niero by email. Weird subject lines work best.\n\n\n\n",

Generally speaking, we make repeated clear and conspicuous disclosures and disclaimers in every author’s biography, and under every editorial where our readers may have any such concern. We view ourselves as a consumer-first publication and do everything in our power to live up to this standard.<\/p>\n<p><strong>EX-DESTRUCTOID STAFF AND ASSOCIATES<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The video games industry is very small, and our job involves getting to know the individuals behind the games we play.

That includes private investments, Kickstarters, Patreons, IndieGoGo, Fig campaigns, and any such other financial contribution that individual staff members are directly involved in or through their family members. These disclosures will also show up in the review itself. If a writer invests in a game, they are barred from writing about it.

For example, if a story is tagged ‘deals’ our software will insert a disclosure stating that we as a company may earn an Amazon.com commission for the sale.

In broad terms, most deals on Destructoid are blogged from the “Dealzon” author account, which also carries a similar disclosure in their bio.

The mobile edition is actually arriving on June 2, but in the near future (<strong>also on June 2<\/strong>), the PC version will be going into “open beta.” Blizzard says that <em>Diablo Immortal <\/em>PC open beta progress will be “maintained” into the full version. So either way, with cross-progression, you’re covered no matter when you start. The publisher re-iterates that there are “30 million pre-registered players” worldwide that comprise the player base.<\/p>\n<p>While the jury is out on <em>Diablo Immortal<\/em>‘s quality as a whole, and how it properly utilizes microtransactions: this is good news for the game as a whole. The “mobile-only” portion of the announcement clearly went over poorly with fans, and if Blizzard can steward the PC version properly, and mold it into something even remotely resembling <em>Path of Exile<\/em>, they could have a little cottage industry for years to come. In fact, if done right, this could be the longest-supported <em>Diablo<\/em> game to date in terms of totally new content.<\/p>\n<p>With Microsoft coming into the picture at some point, it only spells good things for long-term support. But again, the game’s quality will need to shine on its own: and we have just a little over a month to see it for ourselves.<\/p>\n<h2><em>Diablo Immortal<\/em> PC trailer:<\/h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/_sDxsXYn78w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<div>\n<p><img alt src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/ChrisCarterAvatar-2-96x96.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/ChrisCarterAvatar-2-192x192.jpg 2x\" \/> <\/p>\n<div>\n<p><span>Reviews Director, Co-EIC - Chris has been enjoying Destructoid avidly since 2008.

The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/18\/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california\/?guccounter=1\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch Disrupt.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news\/\" target=\"_blank\">left the publisher in the fall of 2021<\/a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.<\/p>\n<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/2Jhfofq-ehw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things<\/em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/18\/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california\/?guccounter=1\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix to expand into cloud gaming, opens new studio in Southern California [TechCrunch]<\/a><\/p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<p><img alt src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/av-96x96.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/av-192x192.jpg 2x\" \/>\t\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span>Chris Moyse<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span>Senior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

So either way, with cross-progression, you’re covered no matter when you start. The publisher re-iterates that there are “30 million pre-registered players” worldwide that comprise the player base.\nWhile the jury is out on Diablo Immortal‘s quality as a whole, and how it properly utilizes microtransactions: this is good news for the game as a whole. The “mobile-only” portion of the announcement clearly went over poorly with fans, and if Blizzard can steward the PC version properly, and mold it into something even remotely resembling Path of Exile, they could have a little cottage industry for years to come. In fact, if done right, this could be the longest-supported Diablo game to date in terms of totally new content.\nWith Microsoft coming into the picture at some point, it only spells good things for long-term support. But again, the game’s quality will need to shine on its own: and we have just a little over a month to see it for ourselves.\nDiablo Immortal PC trailer:\n\n\n \n\nReviews Director, Co-EIC - Chris has been enjoying Destructoid avidly since 2008. He finally decided to take the next step, make an account, and start blogging in January of 2009. Now, he's staff!\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tOverwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs\nNetflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.\nThe new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.\n\nIn addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.\nThe newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.\n\nFor the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.\nNetflix to expand into cloud gaming, opens new studio in Southern California [TechCrunch]\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChris Moyse\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

The next-gen update will also be free for owners of previous-gen versions. PlayStation trophies won’t transfer over between versions, as the two versions are different SKUs. Xbox players can carry achievements over using Smart Delivery.\n\nFor the next-gen versions of Cyberpunk 2077, the new consoles will get ray-traced local light shadows, performance improvements, faster loading, and more. The PlayStation 5 version will also have some DualSense features.\nThere are also two different modes for visual fidelity: Performance and Ray Tracing. The former uses 4K dynamic scaling with 60 FPS, while the latter introduces shadow and reflection rendering at dynamic 4K and 30 FPS. For Xbox Series S owners, it will have one mode defaulted to dynamic 1440p and 30 FPS.\n\nFor all platforms, there’s also an update going live today. Patch 1.5 adds a bunch of new features, including new apartments to purchase, mid-game appearance customization, new weapons, Photo Mode poses, and more.\nCrowd AI and combat have also been updated with a bunch of changes, including NPCs that will draw weapons and fight when provoked (that feature is not available on PS4 or Xbox One versions).

The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/18\/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california\/?guccounter=1\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch Disrupt.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news\/\" target=\"_blank\">left the publisher in the fall of 2021<\/a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.<\/p>\n<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/2Jhfofq-ehw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things<\/em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/18\/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california\/?guccounter=1\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix to expand into cloud gaming, opens new studio in Southern California [TechCrunch]<\/a><\/p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<p><img alt src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/av-96x96.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/av-192x192.jpg 2x\" \/>\t\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span>Chris Moyse<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span>Senior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

So while June is going to be another busy month for live-streamed game showcases, I’ve once again got my eye on the Wholesome Direct, a celebration of cute and cozy upcoming indie games.\nThe Wholesome Direct is back for 2022, and the event is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Pacific on June 11. Here’s a teaser trailer with a preview of some of the curated games.\n\nOn the docket so far, we’ve got:\n\nCoffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus &amp; Butterfly, a visual novel about listening (and being a barista) in a fantasy version of Seattle.\nMail Time, a “cottagecore” delivery adventure game with a glider.\nPuffPals: Island Skies, a farming life sim that looks too pure for this world.\nSCHiM, an eye-catching platformer about jumping between shadows.\nSnufkin: Melody of Moominvalley, a storybook adventure with musical puzzles.\nTerra Nil, a serene building game about revitalizing ecosystems in wastelands.\nAnd a few more, as teased in this video.\n\nSome of these might’ve been on your radar, but most of them are probably new to you.\nThe showcase will air on YouTube on Saturday, June 11, and you can expect to see “new game reveals, exclusive footage, and even games that will launch during the show.”\nFrogun.\nAccording to the organizers of Wholesome Direct 2022, there will be “nearly 100 amazing indie games in total.” Odds are, you’ll see something that clicks with you.\nFor me, just based on the teaser trailer, I know I’m down for Frogun. I continue to be a mark for colorful 3D platforms that throw back to the PS1 era, and this one’s a cutie.\nAs much as we’ve learned to keep our guards up during these past two summers with too many tedious streams, I think spreading the good word about “uplifting, compassionate, cozy video games” is a noble task, and it’s one that’s worth tuning in for again this year.\n\n \n\nJordan is a founding member of Destructoid and poster of seemingly random pictures. They are anything but random.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tOverwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs\nNetflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.\nThe new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.\n\nIn addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.\nThe newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.\n\nFor the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.\nNetflix to expand into cloud gaming, opens new studio in Southern California [TechCrunch]\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChris Moyse\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

As much as everyone is clamoring to see it, we are really, really waiting to release it too.\nEveryone who is working on the project is of course very proud of what we’re doing and wants everyone to see what we’re doing. As much as fans are waiting for it, we are waiting for the day when we can show it. We want everyone to cheer us on as we run to the final stretch. We want to show it too!”\nPlatinum boss Atsushi Inaba chimed in that there’s “no need to worry,” and that the game is proceeding as planned: a sentiment Kamiya has said basically every few months since the game was announced.\nThat announcement, mind, was in 2017. It’s crazy that things would progress to the point where we haven’t even seen it in four years, but that’s Nintendo for you. They have a penchant for dropping news very early, then reworking it into oblivion, or being very careful with their marketing. Metroid Prime 4 is in a similar boat.\n\n \n\nReviews Director, Co-EIC - Chris has been enjoying Destructoid avidly since 2008.

Well, I’ve been <strong>enjoying<\/strong> <em>Final Fantasy XIV<\/em> for X years after the <em>Realm Reborn<\/em> salvaging job came about. And it’s been pretty crazy to see all of its improvements happen in real-time. Yes, <em>Realm Reborn<\/em> was pretty great at launch, but it’s gotten so much better since then.

But before that happened, we got a special presentation from Naoki “Yoshi P” Yoshida himself. It was 45 minutes long. He was rocking a soul patch. Ah, the world of MMO coverage! I wouldn’t trade it for anything.<\/p>\n<p>Yoshida says that although he would have loved to have done an in-person preview this year, it’s basically impossible, noting that Japan is still in a “tough situation,” and he took some time to commend the healthcare industry for allowing his team to continue their work. It’s a bizarre time for both press and developers alike, but it was great to see a heartfelt message from Yoshida, as he’s always been earnest throughout his career, and seems like he actually enjoys his work.<\/p>\n<p>After that brief intro, it was time to get to the content. With music from the expansion blaring in the background, Yoshida gave us his spiel. <em>Final Fantasy XIV<\/em> is now officially at 24 million players, an increase of two million since the last time he checked in, and the game “continues to grow.” Remember when I smack-talked the original version earlier? Yoshida touched on that, noting that it’s amazing how he and his team were able to turn the game around to a “core part of Square Enix’s business” from what it was.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/zTTtd6bnhFs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>It’s been 11 years since they dropped the 1.0 edition, and on September 30, they’ll hit 12 years and four expansions to <em>Realm Reborn<\/em>.

Again, I believe his sincerity here.<\/p>\n<p>He recalls how the game grew from four million members after the launch of <em>Heavensward<\/em> (the first expansion), and how they were “super happy” with that figure because of how they were able to fix the game from its previous state. After <em>Stormblood<\/em> hit, they grew from 10 million to 16 million <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/reviews\/review-final-fantasy-xiv-shadowbringers\/\" target=\"_blank\">before <em>Shadowbringers<\/em> arrived<\/a>. The next milestone was surpassed by the “highly acclaimed” <em>Shadowbringers<\/em>, which now sits at 24 million players. Yoshida vaguely mentioned “10 more years” of plans, and that just because the first saga (Hydaelyn and Zodiark) is over, it doesn’t mean the end.<\/p>\n<p>Onto <em>Endwalker<\/em>, which is still being referred to as their “largest expansion to date” — which he clarifies is both story and playable content. To recap, there’s six areas, a new hub city, two new jobs (Reaper\/Sage), better Trust (CPU party members) AI, new gear\/crafting recipes, the Pandemonium raid, a new alliance raid (Myths of the Realm), new dungeons, male Viera race, Island Sanctuary (“relaxed content”), a new tribe (Loporrits), the new data center travel system, the new Oceania region data center, the Ishgard residential district, and a level cap increase to 90.<\/p>\n<p>“More than anything,” he believes people are interested in the new jobs.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Endwalker-hands-on-preview-1-1.jpg?resize=640%2C341\" alt=\"Endwalker hands on preview 1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Yoshida reiterates from patch 6.1, “a new adventure will begin,” so expect a big finish in the base expansion, as they “tie up loose ends from the last 10 years.” Afterward, the team decided they wanted to “challenge themselves” with a brand new story, and thus the concept for 6.1 was born.<\/p>\n<p>He reminds us that<em> Endwalker<\/em> will “downscale values” alongside battle changes, and reassures players that they have “nothing to worry about.” This is mostly due to calculation overflow bugs (read: big numbers screwing things up internally), and a reduction of floating text for aesthetic reasons. A number given that was reaching untenable heights was a 440,000,000 HP boss battle. “One-fifth of original values” is the basic number provided, but the game should ostensibly feel the same, and you should “still feel stronger” when leveling. “I assure you you’ll get used to it right away,” he says, and it’s for the best for “the next 10 years of service.”<\/p>\n<p>One immediate bonus is a reduction of leveling up XP requirements. Yoshida says that their philosophy has changed over time, and instead of wanting to see players just focus on one or two jobs, they want to try multiple jobs and playstyles. “It will be super easy to level up every single job,” he says, and you’ll be able to “experience more things” as a result of spending less time leveling.<\/p>\n<p>“Inflation” is another concern, which Yoshida is combating by “abolishing the 999 gil [gold] cap” on teleportation (an example of 1,200 gil fees were mentioned). The aim is to “rebalance the economy,” and I’m sure people will have thoughts when the whole process is finalized. Yoshida reminds players that you can favor destinations to reduce the cost. “Concern for the game’s lore” was also considered when adjusting these values.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Endwalker-hands-on-preview-4.jpg?resize=640%2C332\" alt=\"Final Fantasy XIV preview 4\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A big thing Yoshida harped on in the presentation as well was the ability to do more solo content with AI party members via the Trust system. Yoshida intends to make the game more playable solo with the <em>Endwalker<\/em> 6.0 Trust enhancements, and is not concerned about “it becoming a non-MMO” as a result. One of his big points is that there are people who are prone to not wanting to group up, and he wants everyone to still experience the story and the game as a whole. He hopes that those people do gravitate toward group activities, but isn’t overly worried about it.<\/p>\n<p>After that, I was whisked away to the<em> Endwalker<\/em> build (Yoshida says to remind people that this is a “pre-release build that is subject to change”) and swapped to Paladin as quickly as I could (it’s not like people are scrambling for tanks when there’s new healer\/DPS jobs!). My demo included two new areas (Thavnair and Garlemald), level 90 jobs (including Reaper and Sage), the Tower of Zot dungeon, and the Old Sharlayan hub were open. No quests were unlocked.<\/p>\n<p>I’ll start with exploration. Thavnair’s aesthetic heavily leans toward “lush jungle” and it’s completely my vibe. Between the ruins and the menacing structures scattered around it, it’s easily one of the coolest-looking zones in the game. Again, no quests or story content was enabled, so we were only able to fly around it — but I was able to clearly see some of the narrative beats that were about to unfold just due to the strong design alone.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Endwalker-hands-on-preview-5.jpg?resize=640%2C347\" alt=\"Final Fantasy XIV preview\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Garlemald is a <em>Heavensward<\/em>-like snowy area. I started in Camp Brokenglass (edgy name amid a zone torn by war), and made my way to the gigantic broken castle motif, which is the centerpiece of the area. It’s bleak, especially when juxtaposed to Thavnair’s thriving nature.  Old Sharlayan is a pristine town that reminds me a lot of Idyllshire. Right now it’s not overly exciting (though I do love cities with plenty of water), but that might change when the main story quests tie me to it emotionally.<\/p>\n<p>The other big place we could try is the Tower of Zot: a new dungeon with plenty of <em>Final Fantasy IV<\/em> flavor (the Magus Sisters are the core focus and the entirety of the boss gauntlet). You fight two of them sequentially, then all three at once. Combined with the horrifying (and tentacle-filled) art style, it has a ton of flavor. During Zot, I opted to play my go-to Paladin so our group had a tank, with my party members trying out Reaper (x2) and Sage. We cleared it! But afterward, I had to get a feel for both of the new jobs myself and came away impressed on just about every level.<\/p>\n<p>The Reaper was already going to appeal to a certain type of player just based on looks alone, but they back it up mechanically too. The job is heavily combo-based, with some traversal options and positional requirements. In that sense, it reminds me of the Dragoon a bit, but with its own distinct style on several counts. The Reaper has buffs like arcane crest (which creates a barrier for 10% of HP for you and buffs nearby party members when absorbed), or arcane circle (which buffs party damage). Hellsgate lets you slip in and out of jams, and several abilities have a prerequisite state when casting. At first glance, it doesn’t seem like a beginner class, but should satisfy long-time players immediately. It also looks damn cool, which….c’monnnnnn.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Endwalker-hands-on-preview-6-scaled.jpg?resize=640%2C289\" alt=\"Endwalker\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Sage is the healer class and the other new job for <em>Endwalker<\/em>.

It has myriad area-of-effect (AOE) abilities that fire off cool effects and protect the party, which is especially fun to play when first learning the class. It has some straightforward heals and damage abilities, on top of stuff like Phlegma, which damages enemies and heals your party (provided you hit them with the Kardion-granting Kardia ability).

The HUD can be customized, motion sickness can be curbed, and you can even enhance the listening mode range and add infinite underwater breathing. Even enemy accuracy, aggression, damage, resource\/ammo quanitity, and stealth can be manipulated individually. If you were ever frustrated with any aspect of the gameplay in the past, you can likely change it.\n\nIf you’ve already experienced this story and said “I’m good,” you probably don’t need to pick up Last of Us Part 1. The fanatics who played it 10 or more times already probably had this pre-ordered already. That leaves the most important group: total newcomers. While The Last of Us still has some of the same issues the original debuted with in 2013, the PS5 version (and likely the upcoming PC port, based on Sony’s past efforts) is the best way to play it to date.\n\n \n\nReviews Director, Co-EIC - Chris has been enjoying Destructoid avidly since 2008.

                "textplain": "\n\n\n \n\nOver 123 million total scares\nCapcom has announced that its 2020 release Resident Evil 3 has surpassed the five million sales mark. The impressive number takes into account both physical and digital sales on PS4, PC, and Xbox One.\n\nResident Evil 3 — a remake of the 1999 PlayStation title Resident Evil 3: Nemesis — was something of a no-brainer after the incredible success of 2019’s Resident Evil 2 remake, which itself has shifted an enormous 9.3 million units. While still a very solid title, Resident Evil 3 did not find quite the same level of excitement and prestige among critics and fans, with some criticizing the title for feeling unambitious in scope, and dragging its feet a little for the third act. Regardless, the remake was praised for its great visual design, implementation of the RE Engine, and thrilling action set-pieces.\nCapcom also noted that the Resident Evil franchise has now enjoyed a staggering 123 million lifetime sales, which includes all mainline and spin-offs titles set within the globally popular survival horror franchise. The most recent release, 2021’s Resident Evil Village, has already pulled in 5.7 million sales, and with a rumored remake of Resident Evil 4 on the horizon, (arguably the most beloved game in the entire series), it seems that sales — along with rivers of blood and viscera — are set to run and run.\nResident Evil 3 is available now on PS4, PC, and Xbox One.\n\n \n\nSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

As part of those filings, Microsoft says a motivation for the acquisition is to help build out its mobile presence.\nHere’s the relevant item from the CMA filing, as reported on by The Verge:\n“The transaction will improve Microsoft’s ability to create a next generation game store which operates across a range of devices, including mobile as a result of the addition of Activision Blizzard’s content. Building on Activision Blizzard’s existing communities of gamers, Xbox will seek to scale the Xbox Store to mobile, attracting gamers to a new Xbox Mobile Platform.

Microsoft hopes that by offering well-known and popular content, gamers will be more inclined to try something new.”\n\nA more mobile Xbox\nMicrosoft has been pushing more and more into the mobile market. Putting its cloud gaming service on phones makes for pretty good reasons to pick up a controller clip and game on the go.\nBut this new development could see Microsoft opening its own platform, one that would compete with Google’s Play Store and the App Store.\nMobile gaming revenue from Activision Blizzard is strong, as Microsoft notes in the filing. The output of the King side of Activision Blizzard, alongside games like Call of Duty: Mobile, represent a good chunk of revenue.\nThe acquisition remains under scrutiny though, as the CMA continues to investigate.\nIn other Activision Blizzard news, Blizzard Albany workers recently won approval for a union vote.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n \n",

The publisher also says it plans to move into parallel AAA game development starting in 2022. The company has also invested in Digital Scrapes, a Vancouver-based studio that will bolster its other studios.\n\npic.twitter.com\/1AEja0sOI5\n— CD PROJEKT IR (@CDPROJEKTRED_IR) March 30, 2021\n“We are planning to build cross-functional teams to work on both IPs,” said Pawl Zawodny, Head of Production and CTO at CD Projekt, in one slide. “These teams will blend disciplines and expertise, so we have closer communication and skill sharing going on from the beginning.

I’ve been reviewing games professionally for around nine years now. It’s my job to give you an informed opinion of various games out on the market, so you can make a decision on what to spend your money on, or how you choose to spend your afternoons. <\/p>\n<p>By nature, reviews are a subjective beast. They are based on our own individual opinions, and that may not reflect your exact feelings on a game. Best rest assured, we strive for accuracy, and we will do our best to convey why a game made us feel a certain way. It is also our policy to review what’s <em>in<\/em> the game, and not promises of what may come. We often may speculate on future features or facets of a game through the course of a review, but it will not affect the score.<\/p>\n<p>Let me stress that although we do speak to PR on occasion to obtain advance review copies for games, we do not collude with them, any sponsors, or advertising agencies on anything regarding reviews or scores. Our review team is completely and utterly isolated from the ad team.

                "textplain": "\nAverage starts at five, not seven\nHi! I’m Chris Carter, the Reviews Director for Destructoid.com. I’ve been reviewing games professionally for around nine years now. It’s my job to give you an informed opinion of various games out on the market, so you can make a decision on what to spend your money on, or how you choose to spend your afternoons. \nBy nature, reviews are a subjective beast. They are based on our own individual opinions, and that may not reflect your exact feelings on a game. Best rest assured, we strive for accuracy, and we will do our best to convey why a game made us feel a certain way. It is also our policy to review what’s in the game, and not promises of what may come. We often may speculate on future features or facets of a game through the course of a review, but it will not affect the score.\nLet me stress that although we do speak to PR on occasion to obtain advance review copies for games, we do not collude with them, any sponsors, or advertising agencies on anything regarding reviews or scores. Our review team is completely and utterly isolated from the ad team. I have no idea how they conduct their business, and I’d like to keep it that way.\nHow we score – the Destructoid scale\nHere at Destructoid, we use the entire scale. It does not start at “7.” Let me repeat that — if a game is less than “good,” (7) it will be scored as such. Just because a game has obtained a “6” does not mean it’s a “bad,” game — far from it, in fact. If you come into this believing that the only games worth buying are 9’s or 10’s you’re not really understanding what we’re trying to convey. Please take a closer look:\n10 — Flawless  (10s aren’t perfect, since nothing is, but they come as close as you could get in a given genre. The new leader to beat in its sector, we’re talking pure ecstasy.)\n9 — Superb (9s are a hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won’t cause massive damage.)\n8 — Great (8s are impressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won’t astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.)7 — Good (7s are solid and definitely have an audience. There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun.)6 — Alright (6s may be slightly above average or simply inoffensive. Fans of the genre should enjoy them a bit, but a fair few will be left unfulfilled.)\n5 — Mediocre (5s are an exercise in apathy, neither Solid nor Liquid. Not exactly bad, but not very good either. Just a bit “meh,” really.)\n4 — Below Average (4s have some high points, but they soon give way to glaring faults. Not the worst, but difficult to recommend.)3 — Poor (3s went wrong somewhere along the line. The original idea might have promise, but in practice it has failed. Threatens to be interesting sometimes, but rarely.)2 — Bad (2s are a disaster. Any good they might have had are quickly swallowed up by a plethora of issues. The desperate or the gullible may find a glimmer of fun hidden somewhere in the pit.)1 — Failure (1s are the lowest of the low. There is no potential, no depth and no talent. These have nothing to offer the world, and will die lonely and forgotten.)\n[Our scores were reverted back to our original system in April 2016, after using altered descriptions for a year.]\nWhy score games at all, doesn’t Destructoid believe that videogames are an art?\nIn regards to why we use scores at all, our founder Niero set forth these ideas:\n\n\n“To score a game is to take a stand.

                "content": "<div>\n\t\t<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs<\/h2>\n<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/18\/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california\/?guccounter=1\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch Disrupt.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news\/\" target=\"_blank\">left the publisher in the fall of 2021<\/a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.<\/p>\n<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/2Jhfofq-ehw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things<\/em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/18\/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california\/?guccounter=1\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix to expand into cloud gaming, opens new studio in Southern California [TechCrunch]<\/a><\/p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<p><img alt src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/av-96x96.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/av-192x192.jpg 2x\" \/>\t\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span>Chris Moyse<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span>Senior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.\nThe new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.\n\nIn addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.\nThe newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.\n\nFor the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.\nNetflix to expand into cloud gaming, opens new studio in Southern California [TechCrunch]\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChris Moyse\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

A selection of fun character tropes, including a school girl, a volleyball player, a kunoichi, an arrogant “ojou” woman, and a young girl with a giant teddy bear (predating Enchantress by several decades), fight it out in cute ‘n’ colorful action, set against the backdrop of some equally strange locations, such as a fun fair, and a medieval castle!\nCheck out the cute ‘n’ crazy carnage in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Colmarr.\n\nAngel Eyes, despite its seeming irrelevance, had some surprisingly prescient ideas. Not only is it one of the first-ever “all women” fighting games, but it is also one of the first 2D fighters to feature a heavy slant on juggles and air combos. Perhaps its funniest and most bizarre mechanic, however, is reserved for the so-called “reverse combo correction” system, which actually increases damage the longer a combo goes on — rather than scales it back. And thus, players with one or two fairly solid combos can find themselves taking down their opponents in a manner of seconds.\nYou thought Street Fighter V was “three mistakes to death”?

All of that and so much more on Spot Dodge!\n\nI haven’t completed Bayonetta 3 yet, but it’s already everything I hoped it would be and so much more. The action is bat-shit crazy, the new characters are intriguing and well-acted, and the game is so damn fun it helps me look past its performance woes. I’ve played very few games where it’s so abundantly clear it was crafted with truckloads of tender love and care — and in this instance, a pinch of perfume and gunpowder. Bayonetta 3 is the win PlatinumGames has needed in recent years. There’s so much to discuss!\nOur lovely cast from around the web: Brett Medlock (me) and Mary Stowe from Destructoid, John Friscia from The Escapist, Greg Bargas from PC Invasion, and Brett Larsen, our extra special guest. Behind the scenes, Gamurs’ Eric Weichhart is live-editing this week’s show.\nSpot Dodge is a weekly Nintendo Podcast here at Destructoid where we dedicate an hour or two to go over the latest Nintendo news and discuss the games we’re playing. If you’re a fan of Nintendo Switch, RPGs, or having a good time, Spot Dodge will be a great addition to your podcast rotation.\nSpot Dodge is streaming live every Tuesday at 4:00 p.m. PT \/ 7:00 p.m. ET on Destructoid’s YouTube and Twitch channels. Don’t be afraid to join the chat and be part of the show! Note: This week we’re only streaming on the Twitch. Next week we’ll have a dedicated Spot Dodge YouTube channel!\nAfterward, the show will be available on-demand for audio listeners via Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and more. The live video version will remain on both YouTube and Twitch (don’t forget to follow and subscribe). So many options!\n",

But more casual fans that like the characters and wild tales have something to look forward to in next month’s <em>Street Fighter V<\/em>, despite Capcom keeping all story aspects under wraps until now.<\/p>\n<p>I talked with the smiling face of <em>Street Fighter<\/em>, Yoshinori Ono, last week as the team was ready to break down the story. As some expected, the new game follows <em>Street Fighter IV<\/em>, but also promises to explain, “how everything flows into <em>Street Fighter III<\/em>,” incidentally one of the first in the series Ono is credited with. So the existing canon chronology is finally being linked completely.<\/p>\n<p>As for how that works? Every character has a personal Arcade mode story per usual with artwork from famed <em>Street Fighter<\/em> artist Bengus, the main illustrator on <em>Street Fighter Alpha<\/em>. You might have noticed during the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/street-fighter-v-beta-gets-story-tutorial-with-alpha-ken-and-ryu-319186.phtml\">beta’s tutorial<\/a>. This all goes toward what is being considered a “prologue.”<\/p>\n<p><em>Street Fighter V<\/em>‘s story meat is coming as a free expansion to the game in June of this year with, “a more modern cinematic treatment.” That is to say, as you can see in the trailer, it’s all done in-engine with the same character models you’re street fighting with instead of, say, an animated denouement. There is over an hour’s worth of cinematics in total working toward a cohesive whole rolling into <em>Street Fighter III<\/em> chronology. And I’m not sweating the format, given the individual character bits are about commensurate with as much story as the games have presented prior. Now all that’s left is next month’s release.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n <\/div>\n<div>\n<article>\n\t\t\t<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/netflix-games-fifth-studio-chacko-sonny.jpg\" alt=\"netflix games fifth new studio cloud\" \/>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs<\/h2>\n<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/18\/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california\/?guccounter=1\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch Disrupt.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch.

                "textplain": "\n\n\n \n\nFree story expansion coming in summer\n\nStreet Fighter IV had a good grip of 2D animated cutscenes providing some closure to individual characters’ Arcade mode arcs, but as a whole the series has been spinning its wheels in that department, especially compared to competitors like Mortal Kombat X. Street Fighter IV, which takes place chronologically after Street Fighter II (1991) failed even to catch up to Street Fighter III (1997) story-wise.\nAnd while a robust and nostalgic cast seemingly revived Street Fighter IV (and all of its re-releases) and carried it across the last console generation, much of that was due to the competitive and professional scene. But more casual fans that like the characters and wild tales have something to look forward to in next month’s Street Fighter V, despite Capcom keeping all story aspects under wraps until now.\nI talked with the smiling face of Street Fighter, Yoshinori Ono, last week as the team was ready to break down the story. As some expected, the new game follows Street Fighter IV, but also promises to explain, “how everything flows into Street Fighter III,” incidentally one of the first in the series Ono is credited with. So the existing canon chronology is finally being linked completely.\nAs for how that works? Every character has a personal Arcade mode story per usual with artwork from famed Street Fighter artist Bengus, the main illustrator on Street Fighter Alpha. You might have noticed during the beta’s tutorial. This all goes toward what is being considered a “prologue.”\nStreet Fighter V‘s story meat is coming as a free expansion to the game in June of this year with, “a more modern cinematic treatment.” That is to say, as you can see in the trailer, it’s all done in-engine with the same character models you’re street fighting with instead of, say, an animated denouement. There is over an hour’s worth of cinematics in total working toward a cohesive whole rolling into Street Fighter III chronology. And I’m not sweating the format, given the individual character bits are about commensurate with as much story as the games have presented prior. Now all that’s left is next month’s release.\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tOverwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs\nNetflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.\nThe new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.\n\nIn addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.\nThe newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie.

I do have hangups.\nThe more hours I burn away by grabbing “just a few more bricks,” the more I see technical cracks in the foundation with small-but-irritating bugs and even random crashes; the more I realize just how thinly stretched some of these story levels are; the more I wish I could skip takeoff and landing sequences on drawn-out, multi-planet fetch quests.\nWith respect to the bugs, I am afraid about certain goals, like finding the Wandering Wookie on every planet, somehow wigging out before I wrap them up. I’m trying not to dwell on that fear, though. If it happens, it happens, and I hope the patches are frequent.\nSpeaking of, for other co-op players’ sake, I hope the developers add horizontal split-screen. It’s vertical only right now, which I’m used to, but you very well might not be.\nThere’s no such thing as too many studs.\nLet the post-Elden Ring recovery begin\nWhile it’s easy to pick apart so much of LEGO Skywalker Saga critically speaking, weirdly enough, this has ended up becoming the exact right kind of collectathon game I needed to throw myself at after Elden Ring. It’s perfectly low-stakes. Comfy, even. There’s a lot to like about it, even as an infrequent LEGO player who’s (otherwise) tuning out Star Wars at large.\nIf nothing else, take this advice: before you’re in too deep, consider listening to a podcast or music or literally any other audio source every now and then as a shakeup. Otherwise, LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga will fill your head with unshakable earworms. I hear John Williams fanfare when I go to bed, and the music is still playing when I wake up.\n\n \n\nJordan is a founding member of Destructoid and poster of seemingly random pictures.

For the most part, this consists of very straightforward 2D belt-scrolling action, as Kunio, Riki, Kyoko, and Misako throw down with the bullies, street thugs, gangsters, and other Bad Dudes that have the lowdown on the boys’ mistaken confinement.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/FpJ-UYq9T1k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><em>River City Girls Zero<\/em> is a simplistic brawler.

Each character can also put up their dukes to defend against incoming attacks, and all four fighters have their own cool special moves, activated by hitting block and then the requisite attack button.

The “overlap dead zone” is in effect, and quite often victory is to be achieved through “working” the opponent (for example overlapping from above, walking the opponent into corners, or otherwise tricking the A.I.), rather than through smart combat, an admittedly clunky strategy style demonstrated in Technos’ arcade brawlers such as <em>Double Dragon<\/em> and <em>The Combattribes.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/River-City-Girls-Zero-review-wayforward-5.jpg?resize=640%2C422\" alt=\"river city girls zero review fair\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This stiffness is a problem with many early brawlers, but by 1994, the genre had already moved beyond what is offered in <em>Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka<\/em>, which, from a gameplay standpoint, feels years older than contemporaries such as Capcom’s <em>Cadillacs and Dinosaurs<\/em>, or Sega’s <em>Streets of Rage 2<\/em>, both of which had released over two years prior.<\/p>\n<p>The cute Super Famicom sprites offer much personality to our heroes and villains, and the combat is meaty and relentless, but the game’s design barely advanced from the earliest<em> Kunio-kun<\/em> titles, when other series had already begun experimenting with much deeper combat mechanics.  As a result, standard enemy encounters are incredibly samey, while boss battles an exercise in “trickery”. The new engine utilized for <em>River City Girls Zero<\/em> does work to improve the notorious input latency of the original Super Famicom release, making the action here a little more forgiving and responsive to the player.<\/p>\n<p>In the title’s favor, its nicely animated and colorful sprites, variety of citywide locations, and legitimately smooth SNES synth punctuate the action. The anarchic story is also a lot of fun, (you gotta love the police telling our gang of renegade high school kids that it’s fine to take the law into their own hands). Aesthetically and narratively, <em>River City Girls Zero<\/em> lives its cool and compelling “outlaw” vibe, reminiscent of Toei’s excellent array of ’70s gangster flicks.<\/p>\n<p>As the story progresses and our heroes travel around the country, the side-scrolling stages are linked with <em>Road Rash<\/em> style motorcycle sections, where the player guns the hog to the next location, while indulging in footsies with enemy riders. These sections are pretty disappointing, dated even by ’94 standards. The overall problem with <em>Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka<\/em>\/<em>River City Girls Zero<\/em> is that the title lacks a sense of “electricity”, despite its fun story and great soundtrack. Still, as is the case for so many brawlers, the enjoyment is increased with the addition of a second player.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/River-City-Girls-Zero-review-wayforward-3.jpg?resize=640%2C431\" alt \/><\/p>\n<p><em>Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka<\/em> is, without doubt, a piece of gaming history. WayForward recognizes this, and has dressed up the title in a wonderful presentation package. We open with a <em>fantastic<\/em> anime sequence, (when’s the OVA!!?) backed by an absolute fire song from series composer <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MeganMcDuffee\" target=\"_blank\">Megan McDuffee<\/a>. We also get a delightfully meta manga sequence, as Kyoko and Misako pick up a copy of <em>Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka<\/em> for the Super Famicom and attempt to get it running on, (what must be to them), ancient hardware. Kids these days.<\/p>\n<p>We roll credits with another awesome new tune, and scans of the original artwork and instructional manual are also available to peruse as a fun extra. In regards to localization, there are two English translations on offer: A “Literal” translation, which closely follows the original Japanese text, and a “New” translation which is a little tidier and omits the swearing and misogynistic language of the original script. A useful save state function also helps out in some aggravating boss battles. Ironically, <em>River City Girls Zero<\/em> fits the bill as a preserved historical relic better than it does as a retro experience.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/river-city-girls-zero-review-ultimate-edition.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" alt=\"river city girls zero ultimate edition\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As both a<em> Kunio-kun<\/em> and a brawler aficionado, I think it’s marvelous that <em>Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka<\/em> has been given this new lease of life.

The “overlap dead zone” is in effect, and quite often victory is to be achieved through “working” the opponent (for example overlapping from above, walking the opponent into corners, or otherwise tricking the A.I.), rather than through smart combat, an admittedly clunky strategy style demonstrated in Technos’ arcade brawlers such as Double Dragon and The Combattribes.\n\nThis stiffness is a problem with many early brawlers, but by 1994, the genre had already moved beyond what is offered in Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka, which, from a gameplay standpoint, feels years older than contemporaries such as Capcom’s Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, or Sega’s Streets of Rage 2, both of which had released over two years prior.\nThe cute Super Famicom sprites offer much personality to our heroes and villains, and the combat is meaty and relentless, but the game’s design barely advanced from the earliest Kunio-kun titles, when other series had already begun experimenting with much deeper combat mechanics.  As a result, standard enemy encounters are incredibly samey, while boss battles an exercise in “trickery”. The new engine utilized for River City Girls Zero does work to improve the notorious input latency of the original Super Famicom release, making the action here a little more forgiving and responsive to the player.\nIn the title’s favor, its nicely animated and colorful sprites, variety of citywide locations, and legitimately smooth SNES synth punctuate the action. The anarchic story is also a lot of fun, (you gotta love the police telling our gang of renegade high school kids that it’s fine to take the law into their own hands). Aesthetically and narratively, River City Girls Zero lives its cool and compelling “outlaw” vibe, reminiscent of Toei’s excellent array of ’70s gangster flicks.\nAs the story progresses and our heroes travel around the country, the side-scrolling stages are linked with Road Rash style motorcycle sections, where the player guns the hog to the next location, while indulging in footsies with enemy riders. These sections are pretty disappointing, dated even by ’94 standards. The overall problem with Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka\/River City Girls Zero is that the title lacks a sense of “electricity”, despite its fun story and great soundtrack. Still, as is the case for so many brawlers, the enjoyment is increased with the addition of a second player.\n\nShin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka is, without doubt, a piece of gaming history. WayForward recognizes this, and has dressed up the title in a wonderful presentation package. We open with a fantastic anime sequence, (when’s the OVA!!?) backed by an absolute fire song from series composer Megan McDuffee. We also get a delightfully meta manga sequence, as Kyoko and Misako pick up a copy of Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka for the Super Famicom and attempt to get it running on, (what must be to them), ancient hardware. Kids these days.\nWe roll credits with another awesome new tune, and scans of the original artwork and instructional manual are also available to peruse as a fun extra. In regards to localization, there are two English translations on offer: A “Literal” translation, which closely follows the original Japanese text, and a “New” translation which is a little tidier and omits the swearing and misogynistic language of the original script. A useful save state function also helps out in some aggravating boss battles. Ironically, River City Girls Zero fits the bill as a preserved historical relic better than it does as a retro experience.\n\nAs both a Kunio-kun and a brawler aficionado, I think it’s marvelous that Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka has been given this new lease of life. It’s gaming history that needed to be archived, both for the legacy of Kunio-kun and for protagonists Kyoko and Misako, a duo who only have further fantastic adventures ahead. Fans of the series, who can better tolerate its gameplay shortcomings, will squeal with delight that this long-standing hole in their collection has finally been plugged — though even they wouldn’t deny that this entry is, ultimately, one of the series’ weaker offerings.\nRiver City Girls Zero is available now on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. River City Girls 2 is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.\n[These impressions are based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]\n\n \n\nSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

                "textplain": "\nTruffle Shuffle Super\nThose naughty MultiVersus dataminers are at it again, delving into the code of Player First Games’ madcap platform fighter and pulling out clues pertaining to upcoming characters and stages — In fact, just this weekend, one such digger ventured into the new update and surfaced with a reference to the iconic 1985 classic, The Goonies.\nDirected by Richard Donner and written by Steven Spielberg, The Goonies tells the tale of a group of misfit children, who embark upon a wild adventure of danger and intrigue while exploring the legend of notorious pirate One-Eyed Willie. The Goonies has transcended generations due to its dopey slapstick comedy, Indiana Jones-esque action, and litany of quotable lines and memorable characters. Today, decades after its release, it remains something of a rite of passage for young film fans.\n\non the Multiversus Hub server, one of the dataminers there has found a string of Goonies mentioned as a Character Universe, there MIGHT be a chance that Sloth or any of the Goonies characters could come to Multiversus soon but for now, i'd say take it as a grain of salt- pic.twitter.com\/Qq9ri6MObn\n— Susie – Multiversus Leaks (@multiversusie) October 23, 2022\nThe data pulled from the new MultiVersus update includes a “Character Universe” code — essentially a folder in which data is stored by IP, (for example “DC Comics” or “Gremlins”), this would suggest the possibility of one or more Goonies characters might be in the works for the star-studded fighter, though we are probably more likely to get Sloth than we are Mama Fratelli. Of course, this code could also be a “just in case” placeholder, with no confirmed plan to bring in The Goonies anytime soon. We shall see.\nThe Goonies is the latest in a number of unannounced IPs and characters to be found lurking within the MultiVersus code. Previous datamines have uncovered dialogue and\/or references pertaining to DC Comics supervillain Joker, The Ghost with the Most, Beetlejuice, and The Wizard of Oz‘s very own Wicked Witch of the West. To date, none of these characters have been officially confirmed by Player First Games.\nMultiVersus is available now in open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\n\n \n\nSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

This is a series that felt buried roughly two decades ago after <em>Gungrave: Overdose<\/em> on the PS2, but nonetheless <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/reviews\/review-gungrave-vr\/\">we got a so-so VR adaptation<\/a>, and very soon: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gungrave.com\/?g_country=en\"><em>Gungrave GORE<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We had a chance to play a preview build, and it feels like a blast from the past (in ways that will both delight and disappoint).<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Gungrave-GORE-1.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" alt=\"Gungrave GORE 1\" \/><\/p>\n<p>One thing I swiftly noticed after starting up <em>Gungrave GORE<\/em> is how much it asks you to already be somewhat invested in the lore. The quick intro was partially incomprehensible for newcomers, with a lot of exposition required, and less emotional resonance. What you mostly need to know is that anti-hero Grave is trying to kill the Ravenclan, led by four eccentric bosses who, in a literal sense, are big bads in a video game. Some slightly incorrect subtitles later, all my <em>Gungrave<\/em> anime-watching and game-playing knowledge came rushing back.<\/p>\n<p>You aren’t going to be alone if you’re coming in blind and are partially confused. In fact, this passage is straight from the developers:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>“The previous games do not have to be played to experience <em>GORE<\/em>, although certain established concepts might take some getting used to by newcomers, especially revolving around the Seed. The common thread between the games is the Seed and the relationship between Grave and Mika. In a sense, <em>Gungrave GORE<\/em> is the finalization of the Seed story arc and the culmination of Grave’s story since the real super villain is finally revealed and defeated.”<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If you’re just looking for a pure action experience, then you’re probably covered. The intro to the first stage is devilishly over-the-top, with Grave destroying a bunch of goons at the entrance to a facility, before the player takes over and does much of the same. The first thing I noticed, gameplay-wise, was the focus on style: a lost art in many character action games.<\/p>\n<p>There’s a “beat count,” which serves as a combo aggregator of sorts, as well as the classic “diving\/dodge shot” move that made the original games famous among action aficionados. You can also melee (with the coffin on your back) which also deflects rockets, grab enemies, initiate execution kills, or trigger ultimates governed by a meter (which usually involve firing something out of your coffin).<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Gungrave-GORE-2.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" alt=\"Gungrave GORE 2\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There’s <em>a lot<\/em> of goons to kill. Action vets will want to jack the game’s difficulty up to hard right away, as fighting through some of <em>Gungrave GORE<\/em>‘s enemy types and layouts feel like going through the motions. You’ll have access to a shield (which recharges and can fend off raw health damage), which is extremely generous to the point where you can walk through a lot of gunfire and came out unscathed.<\/p>\n<p>It’s an intriguing push and pull. The team clearly wants Grave to to feel like an unstoppable force, and has to balance that around actual tension. Hopefully as levels progress the general pool of enemies will offer up new puzzles and challenges for everyone to conquer: as that’s my main concern.

                "textplain": "\nOld school in a new era\nWhen I first heard that Gungrave was coming back with not one, but two projects, I was in shock. This is a series that felt buried roughly two decades ago after Gungrave: Overdose on the PS2, but nonetheless we got a so-so VR adaptation, and very soon: Gungrave GORE.\nWe had a chance to play a preview build, and it feels like a blast from the past (in ways that will both delight and disappoint).\n\nOne thing I swiftly noticed after starting up Gungrave GORE is how much it asks you to already be somewhat invested in the lore. The quick intro was partially incomprehensible for newcomers, with a lot of exposition required, and less emotional resonance. What you mostly need to know is that anti-hero Grave is trying to kill the Ravenclan, led by four eccentric bosses who, in a literal sense, are big bads in a video game. Some slightly incorrect subtitles later, all my Gungrave anime-watching and game-playing knowledge came rushing back.\nYou aren’t going to be alone if you’re coming in blind and are partially confused. In fact, this passage is straight from the developers:\n“The previous games do not have to be played to experience GORE, although certain established concepts might take some getting used to by newcomers, especially revolving around the Seed. The common thread between the games is the Seed and the relationship between Grave and Mika. In a sense, Gungrave GORE is the finalization of the Seed story arc and the culmination of Grave’s story since the real super villain is finally revealed and defeated.”\nIf you’re just looking for a pure action experience, then you’re probably covered. The intro to the first stage is devilishly over-the-top, with Grave destroying a bunch of goons at the entrance to a facility, before the player takes over and does much of the same. The first thing I noticed, gameplay-wise, was the focus on style: a lost art in many character action games.\nThere’s a “beat count,” which serves as a combo aggregator of sorts, as well as the classic “diving\/dodge shot” move that made the original games famous among action aficionados. You can also melee (with the coffin on your back) which also deflects rockets, grab enemies, initiate execution kills, or trigger ultimates governed by a meter (which usually involve firing something out of your coffin).\n\nThere’s a lot of goons to kill. Action vets will want to jack the game’s difficulty up to hard right away, as fighting through some of Gungrave GORE‘s enemy types and layouts feel like going through the motions. You’ll have access to a shield (which recharges and can fend off raw health damage), which is extremely generous to the point where you can walk through a lot of gunfire and came out unscathed.\nIt’s an intriguing push and pull. The team clearly wants Grave to to feel like an unstoppable force, and has to balance that around actual tension. Hopefully as levels progress the general pool of enemies will offer up new puzzles and challenges for everyone to conquer: as that’s my main concern. The core of jumping\/diving around like an anime action hero is intact.\nThe bosses are the things that, by far, have the most potential to really deliver in GORE. An early one is a giant tank, which requires a fair bit of dodging and focus to take down without sustaining a ton of damage. It’s an early encounter, but it showed a lot of promise in terms of how far GORE could really go, and deliver a modern version of PS2-era chaos. At present, the game is in a really unique position as a niche character action game in 2022.\nGungrave GORE is out on November 22, and I’m curious to see how it will be received by general audiences and Gungrave fans alike. The studio says that it will take “14+ hours” to finish the game, and it’ll run you $50 on both PC and consoles.\n\n \n\nReviews Director, Co-EIC - Chris has been enjoying Destructoid avidly since 2008.

                "textplain": "\n\n\n \n\nLet Them Eat Swarfega\nFor me personally, one of the most intriguing and exciting announcements made during last year’s summer of livestreams was the reveal of Steelrising, an action-RPG currently in production at Greedfall developer Spiders.\nMy interest immediately piqued at the project’s concept: a retelling of The French Revolution, but with an army of lavish, creepy, and sentient androids as the main players in this particularly grim moment of human history. For the reveal, we were given a teaser trailer showing off Steelrising‘s concept and steampunky aesthetic, but things have been very quiet since then, though I’ve remained very curious about the project.\n\nIt seems that development has steadily continued, and Spiders is now ready to start playtesting basic builds of the strange release. The studio will be testing internally, but is also opening up Steelrising to members of the public, offering them an early look at what could prove to be one of 2021’s most unique releases. Interested parties can sign up by filling in this short questionnaire, which asks for the participant’s platform of choice, as well as their experience with titles such as Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Darksiders – which somewhat suggests the gameplay style Spiders is aiming for with Steelrising.\nGreedFall launched in 2019 to a mostly positive but mixed reception. Critics and players appreciated the world and characters Spiders created in its doomsday exploration adventure, but criticized the title for being rough around the edges and inconsistent with some of its mechanics. Hopefully, with the experience of developing GreedFall and the power of next-gen tech under its belt, Spiders can ensure that Steelrising delivers upon its fascinating premise, perhaps even becoming one of the best sleeper titles of 2021.\nRegardless, I’m up to throwdown with Marie Androidette.\n\n \n\nSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.
