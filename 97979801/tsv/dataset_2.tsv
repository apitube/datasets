<h2>At Ease… Dismissed</h2>
<p>Yet another live-service mobile title is being readied for the scrap heap — No big surprise, perhaps, but this particular example is branded with one of the most recognizable gaming IPs of all time. Square Enix has announced that <em><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-vii-the-first-soldier-impressions/"" target=""_blank"">Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier</a>,</em> will be ending service in January 2023.</p>
<p>Originally launched November 2021, <em>Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier</em> is a free-to-play title that tells of the formative years of the Shinra Corporation and its dedicated and ruthless merc army, SOLDIER. Following the typical battle royale format, The First Soldier tasked 75 custom characters with fighting it out in an ever-decreasing circle, procuring weapons and materia on-site in a bid to be the Last Soldier Standing. But it seems, despite the <em>FFVII</em> branding, the experience was not compelling enough to maintain the title’s popularity or profitability.</p>

<p>“It is with a heavy heart that we are announcing the end of service for <em>Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier</em>. We will be ending service at 07:00 UTC on January 11, 2023,” said Square Enix in a public statement. “Despite all our efforts to bring you regular updates with fresh and exciting content, we haven’t been able to deliver the experience that we were hoping to, and that you all deserve, so we have made the extremely tough decision to end service for <em>Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier</em>.”</p>
<p>“We would like to thank you all for supporting us over the past year.”</p>
<p>And thus, a little over a year on from its launch, <em>The First Soldier</em> will be joining a slew of free-to-play, long-life mobile games that have been abandoned scant years, or even months, into their life cycle. Players can still dive into <em>The First Soldier</em> until its final day, although in-game currency “Shinra Credits”, can no longer be purchased from the store.</p>

<p>Good news for PC shmuppers today, as City Connection <a href=""https://twitter.com/claricedisc/status/1583666682303635456?s=20&amp;t=bWibaHxGQ3WU3ZntQ5m5XA"" target=""_blank"">has announced</a> that Cave shmup <em>Akai Katana Shin</em> will be arriving on Steam on December 15, in alignment with its previously announced re-release on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/caves-akai-katana-shin-is-getting-a-re-release-in-december/"" target=""_blank"">As we have previously reported</a>, <em>Akai Katana Shin</em> originally launched on Xbox 360 in 2011, itself a remaster of Cave’s great 2010 arcade release. In typical Cave fashion the dazzling shmup features adrenaline-pumping, bullet-hell action, a beat-heavy soundtrack, and a melodramatic storyline that features a put-upon people, sick of being sacrificed to the titular totem, rising up against their oppressors in a bid for freedom.</p>
<p>Check out a preview of the re-release from April’s FES 2022 stream. The action starts at 33:30.</p>

<h2>SNAAAAAAAAAKE!</h2>
<p>Today is the 35th anniversary of one of the most influential, genre-defining, and beloved franchises in video game history, <em>Metal Gear.</em> That’s 35 years of crawling around in military bases, dodging spotlights, hiding in the backs of trucks and under boxes, and sitting through seemingly endless codec conversations about what date it is. And it’s been one hell of a journey, I’m sure you’ll agree.</p>
<p>While Konami has not seen fit to do anything interesting with the license since series creator Hideo Kojima left the company, <a href=""https://twitter.com/metalgear_jp/status/1547023739371790336?s=20&amp;t=gvi9sf_eB-lso8sCiJc73A"" target=""_blank"">the publisher <em>has</em> announced</a> that it is preparing to re-launch some of the series’ M.I.A. titles, that were discontinued from sale back in November 2021. At the time, Konami noted that there <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/metal-gear-solid-classics-temporarily-removed-from-digital-storefronts-konami/"" target=""_blank"">were licensing issues</a> due to the use of real-life documentary footage in certain games, that the publisher was hoping to renew.</p>
<p>In a tweet posted earlier today, Konami noted that the delisted titles would be returning very soon, though it chose not to mention any of the specific games themselves by name. Is this all we will be seeing in regards to the iconic franchise’s anniversary year? Quite possibly, while Konami is wont to hang on to the brand for obvious financial gain, the studio seems increasingly uncomfortable with the idea of producing new titles with Kojima being a key player in the title’s development. Happy anniversary, please buy these games again. Kind of an anticlimatic anniversary.</p>
<p>Regardless, here’s to the 35th birthday of an undeniable, indelible, 100% genuine game-changer.</p>

<h2>Fantasy puzzle adventurer returns</h2>
<p>505 Games has announced that the third iteration of its fantasy-based brainteaser, <em>Puzzle Quest 3</em>, is headed to PC and mobile platforms next month. The free-to-play sequel will land on Steam, Android, and iOS stores on March 1, with <a href=""https://puzzlequest3.com/"" target=""_blank"">pre-registration now live</a> on the game’s official website.</p>
<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/W2ovW-bSe5s"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Puzzle Quest 3</em> will <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUHgtS5bTkY"">guide players</a> through the dungeons of Etheria, picking their way through labyrinths and catacombs on a mission for loot, gear, and glory. Choose from one of five distinct classes — Paladin, Berserker, Shaman, Assassin, or Necromancer — each with their own unique gear and weaponry before laying waste to armies of monsters in classic <em>Puzzle Quest</em> “Match-3” gameplay.</p>
<p>A selection of multiplayer modes will let players battle against each other in lightning-fast one-vs-one gameplay, or team up in teams of four for cooperative adventures. All of this action plays out against a brand new storyline, punctuated with cinematic sequences and animated battles. Like most free-to-play releases, players can expect weekly challenges, limited-time events, daily quests, and probably a catalog of microtransactions.</p>
<p>Chris Carter <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/puzzle-quest-3-currently-in-early-access-shows-promise/"" target=""_blank"">checked out</a> an early Android version of <em>Puzzle Quest 3</em> last year and thought it was worth a download. “Instead of operating in a turn-based manner, knocking heads against a CPU, you’ll do your thing, the CPU will attack (off-board) and then you’ll do your thing again. It creates a more hectic, and in some ways, less engaging environment. It’s very cool to frantically try to be like ‘OK I need to regenerate mana for this ability, so I need to match this. Then I should do some damage. Then I should create as many combos as possible with the few seconds I have left.’ But at the same time, having the CPU not directly battle you makes individual encounters a little less interesting.”</p>

<p>This question was spurred on <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/y8t8zp/almost_fell_out_of_my_chair_upon_seeing_this/"">by this reddit post by Wickerchair</a>, who mused on playing “400+ hours” of <em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, and <strong>still</strong> coming across a “???” unidentified item.

<p>But what about the missed connections, or abandoned quests?</p>
<h2>For me, it’s the <em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> Korok Seeds</h2>

<p>Growing up, I always had a certain degree of satisfaction 100%ing games. Not every game was “worthy” of it, in that sense, but the ones I really connected to, I did go for it. But the real cherry on top of that sometimes grueling walk to that sundae was the reward. In character action games, it was occasionally a new costume or some insane toggle that fundamentally transformed the game in some way. That’s enough for me.</p>

<h2>Race against the clock</h2>
<p>Netflix’s foray into gaming continues, as its latest movie tie-in is for the action flick <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MysGjRS9jFU"" target=""_blank""><em>Kate</em></a>. Developed by Ludic Studios, <em>Kate: Collateral Damage </em>is a roguelike where you play as Kate herself, racing against poison inside you to exact revenge.</p>
<p><em>Kate: Collateral Damage </em>is described as a time-attack action roguelike. Playing as Kate, you’ve been poisoned and only have a little bit of time to get revenge before it takes you down. A time bar at the top constantly counts down how much time you’ve got left, though syringes can extend your time, or save you from a killing blow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The clock is ticking, you have 24 hours and ONLY revenge on your mind. <img alt=""🔥"" src=""https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f525.svg"" /> KATE: COLLATERAL DAMAGE is coming to Steam on October 22nd. <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://t.co/8HHGqty3GS"">pic.twitter.com/8HHGqty3GS</a></p>
<p>— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1441447381279539204?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">September 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>

Race against the clock
Netflix’s foray into gaming continues, as its latest movie tie-in is for the action flick Kate. Developed by Ludic Studios, Kate: Collateral Damage is a roguelike where you play as Kate herself, racing against poison inside you to exact revenge.
Kate: Collateral Damage is described as a time-attack action roguelike. Playing as Kate, you’ve been poisoned and only have a little bit of time to get revenge before it takes you down. A time bar at the top constantly counts down how much time you’ve got left, though syringes can extend your time, or save you from a killing blow.

The clock is ticking, you have 24 hours and ONLY revenge on your mind.  KATE: COLLATERAL DAMAGE is coming to Steam on October 22nd. pic.twitter.com/8HHGqty3GS

When I saw this update for Russian Subway Dogs, the new game from the creator of They Bleed Pixels, my first thought was “Donald Trump is going to love this.” Not only does it feature three of his favorite things (dogs, fire and Russia) but it’s also related to a comic strip that many say as the perfect metaphor for his campaign.

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

<h2>Round 2 kicks off on Friday</h2>
<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> Just a reminder that the DNF Duel beta is live on PlayStation right now! Have fun, it’s wild!]</p>
<p>As previously predicted, publisher Nexon <a href=""https://twitter.com/DNFDuel/status/1508270149408854016?s=20&amp;t=ukkgwlXd2jwuAiuu26XKSw"" target=""_blank"">has announced</a> a second open beta for its upcoming anime fighting title <em>DNF Duel</em>. Following on from its previous demo efforts in the tail-end of 2021, the fun-looking scrapper will be available to test drive on PlayStation platforms this coming weekend.</p>
<p>Nexon did not reveal a lot of details pertaining to the new beta, but we can probably expect it to feature online-only battles, given that the core goal of the demo is to stress test<em> DNF Duel</em>‘s snazzy rollback netcode abilities. We do know that the recently revealed character Ghost Blade will be available, suggesting that the entirety of <em>DNF Duel’</em>s officially revealed roster to date will be selectable.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dnf-duel-crusader-trailer-open-beta-arc-system-works/"" target=""_blank"">Back in December</a>, the <em>DNF Duel</em> beta was unfortunately timed to coincide with the beta for SNK’s<a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/king-of-fighters-xv-review-playstation-pc-xbox-snk-kof-xv/"" target=""_blank""><em> The King of Fighters XV</em></a>, which led to a lot of people not finding the opportunity to give the fledgling Arc System Works/Eighting fighter a go. While this week brings with it a <em>lot</em> of fighting game updates — including the <em>Street Fighter V</em> “definitive update” and<em> Guilty Gear Strive</em>‘s final season one character, Testament, hopefully, the FGC will find a few hours to jump on the <em>DNF Duel</em> bandwagon, as it really isn’t looking too shabby a title at this early stage.</p>
<p>The beta goes live on Friday, April 1 and will run until the afternoon of Monday, April 4.</p>
<p><em>DNF Duel</em> launches on PlayStation and PC June 28.</p>

Nexon did not reveal a lot of details pertaining to the new beta, but we can probably expect it to feature online-only battles, given that the core goal of the demo is to stress test DNF Duel‘s snazzy rollback netcode abilities. We do know that the recently revealed character Ghost Blade will be available, suggesting that the entirety of DNF Duel’s officially revealed roster to date will be selectable.
Back in December, the DNF Duel beta was unfortunately timed to coincide with the beta for SNK’s The King of Fighters XV, which led to a lot of people not finding the opportunity to give the fledgling Arc System Works/Eighting fighter a go. While this week brings with it a lot of fighting game updates — including the Street Fighter V “definitive update” and Guilty Gear Strive‘s final season one character, Testament, hopefully, the FGC will find a few hours to jump on the DNF Duel bandwagon, as it really isn’t looking too shabby a title at this early stage.
The beta goes live on Friday, April 1 and will run until the afternoon of Monday, April 4.
DNF Duel launches on PlayStation and PC June 28.

<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/sonic-origins-korea-rating-sega-retro-compilation-sonic-the-hedgehog/"">A lot of us have been antsy</a> when it comes to a <em>Sonic Origins</em> release date, and it finally came this morning straight from Sega to Destructoid’s inbox: June 23, 2022.</p>
<p>As Sega points out, this is set to release on “Sonic’s birthday,” and will celebrate the series across several classic games. The final lineup is:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sonic 1</em></li>
<li><em>Sonic 2</em></li>
<li><em>Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles</em></li>
<li><em>Sonic CD</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So the “digital standard version” of the game is $39.99, with a digital pre-order bonus of 100 Medallions, a mirror mode unlock, and a letter box (Mega Drive Pattern). It’s set to release on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Switch. It’ll sport a classic mode (featuring “the original game presentation, with finite lives and a game over screen”), an anniversary mode (“full screen display, with infinite lives”), a missions, medallions, and museum mode (you can earn medallions by “completing various missions throughout the games,” and unlock new content from the in-game vault, including a “special stage”). This is on top of the “all-new visual presentation, animation, and enhancements” makeover.</p>

<p>If you spring for the “Digital Deluxe Edition,” it’ll cost you $44.99, and you’ll get “difficult missions,” a regular letter box, extra characters in the main menu, an “island camera” on the main menu, character animation in music playback screen, and “exclusive tracks from Mega Drive titles” (which is also going to be a separate $3.99 pack if you want). <em>That tiered pricing model definitely isn’t going to alienate anyone!</em></p>
<p>Pre-orders will go live <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://origins.sonicthehedgehog.com/"">at this link</a>. Despite the weird upsell on the digital deluxe version, I think I’m ready to buy a <em>Sonic</em> collection for the 10th time here. Getting it on Switch would hit the spot.</p>

“Starting at $39.99”
A lot of us have been antsy when it comes to a Sonic Origins release date, and it finally came this morning straight from Sega to Destructoid’s inbox: June 23, 2022.
As Sega points out, this is set to release on “Sonic’s birthday,” and will celebrate the series across several classic games. The final lineup is:

Sonic 1
Sonic 2
Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles
Sonic CD

So the “digital standard version” of the game is $39.99, with a digital pre-order bonus of 100 Medallions, a mirror mode unlock, and a letter box (Mega Drive Pattern). It’s set to release on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Switch. It’ll sport a classic mode (featuring “the original game presentation, with finite lives and a game over screen”), an anniversary mode (“full screen display, with infinite lives”), a missions, medallions, and museum mode (you can earn medallions by “completing various missions throughout the games,” and unlock new content from the in-game vault, including a “special stage”). This is on top of the “all-new visual presentation, animation, and enhancements” makeover.

If you spring for the “Digital Deluxe Edition,” it’ll cost you $44.99, and you’ll get “difficult missions,” a regular letter box, extra characters in the main menu, an “island camera” on the main menu, character animation in music playback screen, and “exclusive tracks from Mega Drive titles” (which is also going to be a separate $3.99 pack if you want). That tiered pricing model definitely isn’t going to alienate anyone!
Pre-orders will go live at this link. Despite the weird upsell on the digital deluxe version, I think I’m ready to buy a Sonic collection for the 10th time here. Getting it on Switch would hit the spot.

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

<p>Over 500 Activision Blizzard employees and contractors have signed a public petition calling for the removal of CEO Bobby Kotick.

<p>“We, the undersigned, no longer have confidence in the leadership of Bobby Kotick as the CEO of Activision Blizzard,” the petition opens. What follows is a list of employees from many studios under the Activision Blizzard umbrella who have signed onto the petition, including Activision, Blizzard, King, Raven Software, Infinity Ward, Treyarch, Sledgehammer, and various support studios.</p>

Activision Blizzard employees and contractors declare they ‘no longer have confidence’ in CEO Bobby Kotick
[Update: Since the publication of this piece, the petition has risen to over 1,000 signatures. The ABK Workers Alliance has also opened a petition for supporters who would like to sign. Our original story follows.]
Over 500 Activision Blizzard employees and contractors have signed a public petition calling for the removal of CEO Bobby Kotick. In the wake of a Wall Street Journal report on Kotick’s handling of previous sexual misconduct claims, as well as his own alleged treatment of employees, Activision Blizzard employees are taking a further step in attempting to enact change at the publisher.
“We, the undersigned, no longer have confidence in the leadership of Bobby Kotick as the CEO of Activision Blizzard,” the petition opens. What follows is a list of employees from many studios under the Activision Blizzard umbrella who have signed onto the petition, including Activision, Blizzard, King, Raven Software, Infinity Ward, Treyarch, Sledgehammer, and various support studios.
The ABK Workers Alliance shared the petition earlier today on social media. “The past few days have been rough, but it has strengthened our resolve to make #ABetterABK now more than ever,” the organization said in a later tweet. “Thank you to everyone who joined us for the walkouts. Your solidarity is appreciated. Every voice matters.”

The walkout and petition, as well as other reactions from within Activision Blizzard and without, are all in response to a recent Wall Street Journal report. In it, the Journal detailed several incidents that have taken place over the years at Activision Blizzard, including allegations of CEO Bobby Kotick intervening to keep an employee accused of sexual harassment at the company and allegations of failing to address sexual misconduct within Activision Blizzard.
Kotick issued his own response, shared in text form on the Activision Blizzard investors site. The Board of Directors also issued a statement, saying it remained confident in Kotick’s leadership.
Meanwhile, a report from Bloomberg says PlayStation chief Jim Ryan expressed “deep concern” over the response, and that they’ve reportedly reached out to Activision Blizzard to see how they plan to address the claims. “We do not believe their statements of response properly address the situation,” said Ryan.
A shareholder group has also called for Kotick’s resignation. Game Developer reported yesterday that, in internal meetings, Activision Blizzard leadership continued to stand by Kotick. This all comes in the wake of investigations into the company for discrimination, harassment, and a toxic culture from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing.

<h2>And he’s coming to PC and consoles</h2>
<p>It has been revealed that a video game based on <em>The Adventures of Tintin</em> is currently in development. The announcement was made by publisher Microids, which is collaborating with Moulinsart – the company responsible for curating the Tintin IP – to bring the boy reporter’s antics to PC and consoles.</p>
<p>For uncultured swines, <em>The Adventures of Tintin</em> was a comic drawn and written by Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, better known by his nom-de-plume Hergé.

Over the years, <em>The Adventures of Tintin</em> has been adapted into several TV series, and hit the big screen in 2011 via CGI movie <em>Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn. </em>Tintin has also featured in several video games, including 1989’s <em>Tintin On the Moon</em>, and 1995’s <em>Tintin in Tibet</em>.</p>
<p>Described by Microids as an action-adventure title, <em>The Adventures of Tintin</em> will “transport the player into a whirlwind of incredible situations and suspense,” and will feature other popular series characters, including the finicky Professor Calculus and dopey twin detectives Thomson &amp; Thompson.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

<p>Seeing a ton of classic franchises (I think the DS is a “classic” system at this point) move to free-to-play has been wild, and to say it’s had a mixed reception is understating it. <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/puzzle-quest-3-pc-ios-android-march-1/""><em>Puzzle Quest 3</em></a> is out now on mobile <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/1380410/Puzzle_Quest_3/"">and early access PC/Steam</a>, and it’s adopted that very same approach with free-to-play.</p>
<p>As a match-three, the monetary shift <em>kind</em> of makes sense, as games have normalized that system in the genre for nearly a decade (RIP fully-fledged premium Popcap games). And things can change during early access, but right now, <em>Puzzle Quest 3</em> is still going with the free-to-play system, and utilizes the same gameplay loop of battling foes as the older entries.</p>
<p>Paladin, Berzerker, Shaman, Assassin, and Necromancer classes are a go, and multiplayer co-op and PVP are also bold choices for a match-three as a whole. An intricate loot system is meant to sate folks who want to keep playing, which could go horribly right or badly wrong depending on how it’s handled long term.</p>
<p>Hopefully developer Infinity Plus 2 and publisher 505 Games use the early access time to shore everything up, so when this thing fully launches, it puts its best foot forward. If you’re curious, you can try it now for yourself.</p>
<p>[<strong>Update: </strong>Alongside of the game’s release, the <em>Puzzle Quest</em> team sent us this cute scratch-off that’s appropriately match-three oriented. I wonder what the prize is?]</p>

<p>As Prime Gaming continues to shuffle in new games alongside of other publisher-driven services, Amazon Prime subscibers have new games to claim.

<p>If you need a refresher, here is what <em>StarCraft: Remastered</em> does differently:</p>

<li>Full graphical upgrade of the original <i>StarCraft</i> and the <i>StarCraft: Brood War </i>expansion</li>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

A StarCraft: Remastered free download is front and center for this newest Prime Gaming update: set to arrive at the start of August.
As Prime Gaming continues to shuffle in new games alongside of other publisher-driven services, Amazon Prime subscibers have new games to claim. Several are relatively unknown, a few are higher-profile indies (comparatively), and the one Amazon chose to put front and center is StarCraft: Remastered. Not paying for a Blizzard game sounds pretty great right now to a lot of people, I bet.
If you need a refresher, here is what StarCraft: Remastered does differently:

Full graphical upgrade of the original StarCraft and the StarCraft: Brood War expansion
Widescreen UHD support for up to 4K resolution
New matchmaking and leaderboards
Player profiles that track individual statistics
Cloud saving for campaign progress, hotkeys, and replays
Higher fidelity music and sound
Switch between Remastered and the original StarCraft

Beyond StarCraft: Remastered, you can find the full free lineup below.

August 2022 free games with Prime month:




StarCraft: Remastered

		Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs
Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.
The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.

In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.
The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.

For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.

<h2>No heist here</h2>
<p>It has been almost exactly two years since we first learned about <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/former-head-of-rockstar-north-sues-developer-alleges-150m-in-unpaid-royalties-354958.phtml"">Leslie Benzies’ lawsuit against Rockstar</a>. Benzies, the former head of Rockstar North and a longtime producer of the studio’s biggest games, alleges that he was forced out of the company and is owed $150 million in unpaid royalties. The judicial system doesn’t agree with that claim.</p>
<p>Benzies’ case mostly relies on a royalty agreement that escalated him to “Rockstar Principal” — a small group of key players who are most responsible for the companies success. The agreement is essentially a profit sharing arrangement meant to provide extra compensation to Benzies and Rockstar co-founders Sam and Dan Houser. Benzies argues the Housers were given more money than him during his 17-month sabbatical.</p>
<p>However, as reported by <a href=""https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-04-09-former-gta-producer-suffers-setback-in-usd150m-lawsuit-against-take-two"" target=""_blank"">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the New York Supreme Court recently ruled that Rockstar does not owe Benzies $150 million. Its interpretation of the contract finds that there’s no language suggesting mandatory equal payments, and that it only accounts for “discretionary royalty payments.” This makes the agreement seem like a good faith-based arrangement that’s meant to compensate bonuses whenever Rockstar feels they’re warranted.</p>
<p>All is not lost for Benzies, though. The court also ruled he is still entitled to certain royalties that went unpaid. Benzies also successfully argued that there was a breach in his employment agreement that revolves around salary and stock options. It’s likely that Benzies will squeeze some more money out of Rockstar before it’s all said and done. He just won’t squeeze out $150 million.</p>

<h2>Even Yoko Taro has responded to the quest</h2>
<p>There’s been quite a commotion in the <em>Nier </em>fandom the last few days. Following several video posts from one player, other <em>Nier: Automata </em>players are now on the hunt for a secret church area.</p>
<p>The discovery lit up this week, but actually started a while ago. Reddit user u/sadfutago posted to the <em>Nier </em>subreddit <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/NieRFanart/comments/v92cw8/hello_how_do_you_open_the_church/"" target=""_blank"">two months ago</a>, asking how to “open the church” in <em>Nier: Automata</em>. And in follow-up posts, sadfutago asked more, providing more <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/vcplik/hello_does_anyone_know_how_to_open_up_the_dors_to/"" target=""_blank"">details and images</a>. And then, what really blew up, was <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/w7iq02/hello_here_is_the_video_for_the_clip_i_recorded/"" target=""_blank"">the video of it</a>.</p>
<p>This might seem banal, but the thing is, this church is not a known area. No one playing <em>Nier: Automata </em>knew what sadfutago was talking about. This door just seemed to appear for this player, during the A2 section of the game, and led to quite a startling locale.</p>
<p>As user u/xxk_ shares on the <em>Nier </em>subreddit, the modding community has been <a href=""https://old.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/w84aeo/important_info_about_the_church_from_the_discord/"" target=""_blank"">looking into this for a while</a>. But the most recent post, combined with word of mouth on social media, brought on a swarm of attention.</p>
<p>The community currently has a few points to go on, as sadfutago says they are playing a 1.0 copy of <em>Nier: Automata</em>, on a PlayStation 4 that has been disconnected from the internet since starting the game.</p>
<h2>The hunt for <em>Nier </em>church</h2>
<p>As xxk outlines, modders have not discovered any evidence this exists. There hasn’t been a successful attempt to replicate it, as of this writing, and assets like these also don’t exist. The church pews and first door in the Copied City, for example, are not found elsewhere. And existing geometry at the location doesn’t indicate it would support a door.</p>
<p>That said, if this is a mod, <em>Nier </em>modders say this would be the first time anyone has managed to do something like this. They say it would be a “relatively IMMENSE undertaking for a single individual” to accomplish.</p>
<p>In essence, we have a band of players and fans feverishly hunting for a scene that may or may not actually exist. And adding onto the pile, new footage was released today, showing a cutscene (albeit with recycled voice-over) and some easy speculation fodder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The user has posted a follow-up video showing the secret area in far more detail. It features an unseen cutscene on top of everything else. The voice-over used is recycled from elsewhere in the game. The game also for some reason has the ""item"" and ""door"" arrow prompts disabled. <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://t.co/UvDpTE2hQ0"">pic.twitter.com/UvDpTE2hQ0</a></p>

<h2><em>Nier</em>-ly all secrets</h2>
<p>So yes, this has essentially consumed the <em>Nier </em>fandom. The <em>Nier </em>modding Discord has seen an influx of new users looking for the latest updates. Modders are attempting various means of recreation and experimentation while also trying to get more info from the elusive original poster. And speculation runs rampant as to what the church could mean, what these assets could be, or how this is all happening in the first place.</p>
<p>Today, even the <em>Nier </em>development team started commenting on it. Producer Yosuke Saito <a href=""https://twitter.com/SaitoYosuke_Z/status/1551909607521812482"" target=""_blank"">tweeted about it</a>, saying “Eternal mystery…” And director Yoko Taro <a href=""https://twitter.com/yokotaro/status/1552004563225706496"" target=""_blank"">quote-tweeted a video</a> of the section, referring to his Twitter profile.</p>

<p>His Twitter profile, by the way, says “I can’t answer about any products. Please ask publisher.” (We have reached out to Square Enix to ask about the secret church door.)</p>
<p>This has spurred on theories of this being an elaborate marketing scheme or ARG, possibly around <em>Nier: Automata</em>‘s Switch debut <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/nier-automata-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-this-fall/"" target=""_blank"">this coming fall</a>.</p>
<p>At this point, just about anything’s possible. It could be an elaborate hoax, or some incredibly obscure development relic, or some viral marketing scheme. I’m not ready to count out anything, especially with a developer like Yoko Taro. The wheels are far enough off the tracks that a fake-out in the community Discord spun up a heated chat spam, ending in a Rick Roll. At this point, the sheer fervor is just as entertaining as the possibility of new discoveries.</p>
<p>Either way, it’s a great reminder that <em>Nier: Automata </em>is an <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-nier-automata/"" target=""_blank"">extremely good game</a>. So good, in fact, that players can still be whipped into a frenzy over a secret church door years after its release.</p>

<p>Some version of a real life, widespread virtual reality world has been an aspiration of sci-fi enthusiasts for decades, and as technology has improved in recent years, that dream has become closer than ever before.

‘I am truly sorry to everyone who was hurt’
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has released a video statement addressing the stories of toxic culture and sexual harassment at the developer/publisher, which in recent months had led to intense scrutiny within the studio’s walls, and the firing of several high-ranking employees.

<h2>I hope we get a single player version of this region eventually</h2>
<p>Bethesda has given us a glimpse into more <em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/the-next-big-fallout-76-update-is-still-slated-for-december/"">Fallout 76</a></em> concept art, thanks to a special (SPECIAL) post <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4QqxRe0mmO9Td9s0sbqGFt/fallout25-fallout-76-concept-art"">on their blog this week.</a></p>
<p>As the blog suggests, and as is usually the case with concept art, a ton of potential ideas were sketched on various canvases:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Hundreds – if not thousands – of individual pieces, from napkin sketches to entire painted landscapes, are created when crafting the world of a <em>Fallout</em> game. Concept art like this not only gives the developers details for making assets, they help set the look, feel and tone of the world players are about to inhabit.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In a small series of “never-before-released” concept art, we got to see a Scorchbeast, as well as the emergence from Vault 76, a look at The Pitt, and some environmental designs. The last piece, a collage of life in a vault, looks lovely. The blog concludes with <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/47857688@N08/albums/72157629320774861"">a link to Adam Adamowicz’s concept art gallery on Flickr</a>, who provided a lot of the artistry for <em>Fallout 3</em>.</p>
<p>While <em>Fallout 76</em> has made big strides since its tumultuous launch, this concept art really showcases how much potential an Appalachian fully-fledged, kept-in-the-oven-until-it-was-done new <em>Fallout</em> could have been. It could take a while, but I hope that <em>Fallout 76</em> isn’t the last we’ve seen of this region. I guess there’s always an opportunity for DLC in some far future <em>Fallout</em> iteration.</p>

This lamb got the chops
Devolver Digital’s comically unnerving roguelike, Cult of the Lamb, has ironically become something of a cult hit itself, winning over fans with its creepy-cute visuals, anarchic attitude, and engaging gameplay — In fact, Massive Monster’s indie hit has already bagged its first Game of the Year award, courtesy of the Australian Game Developer Awards.
The event, which took place on the evening on October 4, recognized the best of interactive entertainment from 2022 to date, focusing mostly on the output of independent studios working within the region.

It became a viral meme seemingly overnight, but this genius comedy game didn’t come from nowhere. The people who made <em>Trombone Champ</em> had to stick with it for three difficult years, working only on nights and weekends, to put it all together.</p>
<p>The game was created by industry veterans Dan and Jackie Vecchitto.

Everyone relates with a sad trombone
A couple of times a year, a “Phenomenon Game” pops up out of nowhere and is suddenly the talk of the town. Trombone Champ fits that description. It became a viral meme seemingly overnight, but this genius comedy game didn’t come from nowhere. The people who made Trombone Champ had to stick with it for three difficult years, working only on nights and weekends, to put it all together.
The game was created by industry veterans Dan and Jackie Vecchitto. They’ve been self-publishing games for about a decade, and most of their projects have been free. Trombone Champ is actually the first title they’ve ever sold on Steam, so you can imagine their surprise when it went on to sell 20,000+ copies in its launch window, prompting NBC, The New York Times, and the CBC to all come calling for interviews.

Much to my surprise, they were also willing to talk to me for my Talking to Women about Videogames podcast (also on iTunes and Spotify). It’s a small-time show by NBC standards, but since they had an OK time on Sup, Holmes (an interview live stream show for game devs I used to do), I guess they didn’t mind coming back for another talk eight years later. I’ve been rooting for these two ever since then, long before I knew they were the people who made Trombone Champ, and it’s been so great to see those roots grow into a tree made of trombones, thousands of dollars, and mainstream media attention.

But the real cherry on top of that sometimes grueling walk to that sundae was the reward. In character action games, it was occasionally a new costume or some insane toggle that fundamentally transformed the game in some way. That’s enough for me.
But 900 Zelda: Breath of the Wild Korok Seeds with no real reward? That’s where I check out!

<h2>A trio of <em>Front Mission</em> Remake projects are coming to Switch</h2>
<p>Nintendo gave us the rundown on the trio of <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/front-mission-1-and-2-are-getting-remakes-for-the-switch/""><em>Front Mission Remake</em> titles</a> today during this morning’s <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJ9Iz7HhU-I"">Nintendo Direct</a>. <strong>Wait, three</strong>? Yep!</p>
<p>The initial remake (titled <em>Front Mission 1st: Remake</em>) is out in November (originally slated for “summer” of 2022), with the sequel coming “next year.” These were already announced. However, there’s also a <em>Front Mission 3</em> project announced “for the future.”</p>
<p>Here’s a recap of what to expect from Nintendo: “You’ll pilot giant machines called Wanzers in tactical turn-based combat. As you progress, you’ll obtain Skills that can help you gain the upper hand against opponents. Continue the battle in the sequel, <em>Front Mission 2</em>: Remake, previously unreleased outside of Japan! Take advantage of additional features, like more terrain effects, weapon and armor attributes, and over 80 new skills. You can also test your mettle at the Colosseum and use the Network system to gain intel on events as they unfold.”</p>
<p>There’s no shortage of strategy games available on the Switch, whether it’s restored classics or brand-new projects. The third game, however, is really the one I’m waiting for. It’s one of my all-time favorite strategy games, and that box art is burned in my mind. I mean, it’s just a mech and a brown color scheme! But it stuck with me.</p>

<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/dinabass/status/1308069800883621891?s=20"">According to Bloomberg’s Dina Bass</a>, future Bethesda titles will be released for PC and Xbox, with other consoles included on a “case-by-case basis.” The acquisition will not affect PlayStation’s previously secured timed-exclusivity deal on <em>Deathloop</em> and <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo.</em>]</p>
<p>Microsoft will purchase ZeniMax Media/Bethesda in what is described as an “industry-shaking” acquisition. The news was <a href=""https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1308028385877204993?s=20"" target=""_blank"">initially posted on Twitter</a> by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, before <a href=""https://twitter.com/XboxWire/status/1308028820545396736?s=20"" target=""_blank"">being made official by Microsoft</a> mere minutes later.</p>
<p>Microsoft purchased ZeniMax Media for $7.5 billion USD, which gives Microsoft immediate ownership of Bethesda, partner studios such as id Software and MachineGames, and lucrative video game brands including<em> Doom</em>, <em>Fallout</em>, <em>Prey</em>, <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>, <em>Wolfenstein</em>, and<em> Dishonored</em>, among others.</p>
<p>“Over the years I’ve had many deep conversations with the creative leaders at Bethesda on the future of gaming and we’ve long shared similar visions for the opportunities for creators and their games to reach more players in more ways,” <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/21/welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/"">said Xbox Head Phil Spencer.</a> “Like us, Bethesda are passionate believers in building a diverse array of creative experiences, in exploring new game franchises, and in telling stories in bold ways. All of their great work will of course continue and grow and we look forward to empowering them with the resources and support of Microsoft to scale their creative visions to more players in new ways for you.”</p>
<p>This is, of course, an incredible coup right before the dawn of a new generation of gaming, announced just one day before pre-orders go live on Xbox’s new gaming hardware, <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/xbox-series-x-launches-november-10-priced-at-499-603026.phtml"" target=""_blank"">Xbox Series X</a> and <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/xbox-series-s-officially-revealed-priced-at-299-602897.phtml"" target=""_blank"">Xbox Series S</a>.</p>

And a belief we should bring that to everyone – regardless of who you are, where you live, or what you play on. Regardless of the screen size, the controller, or your ability to even use one.”</p>
<p>Is this a suggestion that Bethesda’s titles will <em>not</em> be Xbox exclusives going forward, despite the Microsoft ownership? It reads like one, though Howard could simply be referencing the PC and mobile markets. Either way, the truth will out as the two companies move together into the impending new generation.

<h2>So, who’s on deck for the next mainline game?</h2>
<p><em>Resident Evil Village</em> left us off on a wild note, with so much room to speculate about the near and long-term future of the series. In between releases, it’s always been fun for me to put the pieces together, theorize, and then ultimately see Capcom take a different direction than the clues might’ve suggested. A new quote out of Tokyo Game Show 2022 has rekindled the conversation, specifically with respect to the upcoming <em>Shadows of Rose</em> DLC for <em>Resident Evil Village</em> and where the series could go with the next mainline entry.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-villages-shadows-of-rose-dlc-will-conclude-the-winters-family-saga"" target=""_blank"">As reported by IGN out of Tokyo Game Show</a>, director Kento Kinoshita says that Capcom is “creating the <em>Shadows of Rose</em> story to conclude the Winters family saga.”</p>
<p>A short and open-ended but very thought-provoking quote, to be sure.</p>
<p>Without spoiling anything, this remark changes my expectations for what kind of story <em>Resident Evil 9</em> (reminder: we don’t have an actual name yet so that’s just shorthand) might tell. (That closing <em>Village</em> scene was a head-turner at the time.) Now I’m even less sure about what to expect — just unresolved bits and pieces that were seeded in <em>Village</em>.</p>
<p>Is it time for old favorites to shine again? To bury <a href=""https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Umbrella"" target=""_blank"">Umbrella</a> once and for all? Once we know the core playable cast and setting, we’ll have a much better picture.</p>
<figure><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Resident-Evil-Village-Shadows-of-Rose-Megamycete-screenshot.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""Shadows of Rose Megamycete"" /><figcaption><sub>I hope the DLC doesn’t feel like too much of a retread.</sub></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Jumping ahead</h2>
<p>For more context (<strong><em>Village</em> plot spoilers</strong>), here’s how Capcom originally framed the <em>Shadows of Rose</em> DLC <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/resident-evil-village-expansion-gold-edition-rose-third-person/"" target=""_blank"">when it was announced</a>: “Set 16 years after the events of <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, this new tale follows Rose Winters, the daughter of main protagonist Ethan, as she struggles with her terrifying powers. Players must explore and survive a warped and mysterious realm inside the consciousness of the Megamycete in search of a cure.”</p>
<p>Some fans, who have had enough of Ethan’s “everyman” antics across <em>Resident Evil 7</em> and <em>Village</em>, are hopeful that <em>Resident Evil 9</em> will combine the old and the new. Personally, as much as I do want to see Jill Valentine (or others!) back in action, particularly after digging her refreshed characterization in the <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-resident-evil-3-2020/"" target=""_blank""><em>Resident Evil 3</em></a> remake, I like the Winters storyline and would’ve been fine seeing it wrapped up in the next game. As is, I’m wondering if this DLC will feel significant enough for people like me, or if it’ll seem shoehorned.</p>
<p>We’ll find out what’s going down on October 28, when <em>Shadows of Rose</em> debuts as part of <em>Resident Evil Village Gold Edition</em> and the <em>Winters’ Expansion</em>. My Halloween plans are set.</p>
<p>I’ll also be back in for the new third-person mode. According to producer Masachika Kawata, the mode “took about as much effort as creating a new game” due to the “exceptionally large variety of player actions” in <em>Resident Evil Village</em> compared to <em>Resident Evil 2</em> and <em>3</em>. “You can guard, you can move while crouching, and there is a lot of examining objects. We made thorough adjustments to ensure that those unique animations would look completely connected, and that it would be playable at a good tempo.”</p>

As is, I’m wondering if this DLC will feel significant enough for people like me, or if it’ll seem shoehorned.
We’ll find out what’s going down on October 28, when Shadows of Rose debuts as part of Resident Evil Village Gold Edition and the Winters’ Expansion. My Halloween plans are set.
I’ll also be back in for the new third-person mode. According to producer Masachika Kawata, the mode “took about as much effort as creating a new game” due to the “exceptionally large variety of player actions” in Resident Evil Village compared to Resident Evil 2 and 3. “You can guard, you can move while crouching, and there is a lot of examining objects. We made thorough adjustments to ensure that those unique animations would look completely connected, and that it would be playable at a good tempo.”

The remake will be a timed PS5 console exclusive
Today’s Silent Hill Transmission showcase started out with some big news. Silent Hill 2 is being remade by horror game studio Bloober Team.
The remake is being made for PlayStation 5 and PC, and will be a timed console exclusive for PlayStation for 12 months, according to today’s trailer.
In the trailer, you can see many scenes from the original game, remade by Bloober in collaboration with Konami.

Bloober is working with original creature designer Masahiro Ito and composer Akira Yamaoka on the project.
What’s old, what’s new
While it’s retaining a similar vibe and working with the original creators, Bloober is also trying to make a strong impression, the same as the original had on PS2.
“While we want to achieve the same end result, players expectations evolve over time, and certain things need to be modernized to have the same or similar effect,” said creative director and lead designer Mateusz Lenart.

One change Bloober highlights is moving the camera to over-the-shoulder. The team is also doing some new motion capture, as shown in today’s showcase.
Konami and Bloober haven’t locked a release date or window yet for the Silent Hill 2 remake.

<h2>DC FanDome begins Oct. 16 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific</h2>
<p>Given Rocksteady’s track record with the fondly remembered <em>Batman: Arkham</em> series, I should be down for <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> without caveats, but I’ll need more convincing before it even approaches no-brainer territory. For now, here’s a screenshot.</p>
<p>The news-filled <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dc-fandome-2021-will-feature-updates-on-gotham-knights-and-suicide-squad/"" target=""_blank"">DC FanDome 2021</a> event starts tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. Pacific, and to get us in the Superman-stopping (or at least <em>slowing down</em>) mood, Rocksteady’s Sefton Hill tweeted out an image of the upcoming <em>Suicide Squad</em> game for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X.</p>
<p>It feels like such a long time coming — are we getting gameplay this weekend?</p>

<p>Yep, that’s Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, King Shark, and Harley Quinn all right. All four characters are playable — if you’re alone, you’ll have AI assistance, otherwise, you can team up with three other players in “open-world Metropolis.” There’s so much left to learn.</p>
<p>Even if this isn’t my preferred cast of characters for a comic-based video game, especially when we’re talking about Rocksteady’s once-in-a-blue-moon output, I think I can be convinced, and I have no doubts about <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> probably looking cool and fun and polished. For me, it really just comes down to the “<span>genre-bending action-adventure shooter</span>” foundation and how that resonates with solo play compared to co-op.</p>
<p>It’s not the end-all-be-all — or at least I don’t think it’ll be once the dust settles — but fans are still concerned about potential live-service-game woes, and real or not, those unfilled blanks are impacting <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/rocksteadys-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-looks-like-a-gaas-gaas-gaas/"" target=""_blank"">the perception</a> of this game. We’ve been burned before!</p>
<p>Hopefully tomorrow’s DC FanDome showing will be illuminating and we’re left feeling confident about the <em>Suicide Squad</em> game. (Reminder, it’s not coming to PS4 or Xbox One; it’s next-gen and PC only.) The launch is still penciled in for 2022, so we might get a release date or window, and worst case, there’s going to be a new trailer for <a href=""https://twitter.com/TheBatman/status/1449042382876467205"" target=""_blank""><em>The Batman</em></a>.</p>

<p>The new date was <a href=""https://twitter.com/GothamKnights/status/1501558438681317380"" target=""_blank"">revealed this morning</a>, and shared on social media.

Co-op action game Gotham Knights has finally set a release date. WB Games Montreal’s brawler will take to the streets of Gotham on Oct. 25, 2022.

<p>Even from this short video, we can already see that <em>DNF Duel</em> will feature the deep lore and delightful melodrama of its MMO source material. In the clip, we see Berserker going, umm, berserk, the spritely Striker dodging trouble in the woods, and the noble Dragon Knight having a bit of a lie-down. The scenes have full voice acting and sport some very nice, comic-book style artwork.

A Striker, a Berserker, and a Dragon Knight walk into a bar…
Publisher Nexon has released a very short video offering the first glimpses of the story mode for its upcoming fighter, DNF Duel. The anime scrapper, which launches on PlayStation and PC next month, will see the classes of MMO Dungeon Fighter Online gather for some solid one-on-one slugfestin’

Even from this short video, we can already see that DNF Duel will feature the deep lore and delightful melodrama of its MMO source material. In the clip, we see Berserker going, umm, berserk, the spritely Striker dodging trouble in the woods, and the noble Dragon Knight having a bit of a lie-down. The scenes have full voice acting and sport some very nice, comic-book style artwork. In addition, the new trailer also includes a look at a gallery mode, as well as an in-game glossary — no doubt to help newcomers get up to speed in the world of Dungeon Fighter Online.
DNF Duel, first revealed back in the winter of 2020, has spent the past year turning heads with its dramatic and action-packed trailers, rad character designs, and promises of enthralling battles powered by silky-smooth rollback connections. Recent betas, (poorly timed to coincide with other popular betas and game releases), did not exactly set the FGC alight, but many players found enjoyment in DNF Duel‘s specific brand of fantasy carnage. Having covered the title every step of the way since its initial reveal, I’m very anxious to check out the scrappy underdog in its final form.
DNF Duel launches on PlayStation and PC June 28.

<h2>Bad year, great games</h2>
<p>Hey kids! I hope you had a fun and frisky 2021. I guess it’s possible that you did, but for most of us, it was pretty torturous. I know I shouldn’t complain. No one close to me got super sick, I kept my job, and despite the constant stress and drain that came from maintaining in the midst of year two of a global pandemic, I still managed to get <a href=""https://twitter.com/NonTrotski/status/1477403486870454277"" target=""_blank"">a bunch of cool projects done</a>. I even have <a href=""https://twitter.com/NonTrotski/status/1477435778112364545"" target=""_blank"">a sheep named after me in <em>The Good Life</em></a>.</p>
<p>But I also shouldn’t pretend to be happy with 2021 when I’m not. This year was disillusioning, both in and out of the games industry. Many great titles were relatively ignored while mostly-worthless trends like NFTs seemed to be everywhere. Tons of people in power throughout the industry were revealed to have done terrible things. And to cap it all off, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/square-enix-president-delivers-cryptic-message-on-nfts-in-new-years-letter/"">the CEO of Square Enix capped off the year</a> by saying that he wants to move in a “games are not for fun” direction. The cream was sinking to the bottom while the turds rose to the top. It’s enough to make you want to throw in the blood-soaked, stinking towel.</p>
<p>But there were many, many games that kept that towel soft and warm. Just playing games, as opposed to writing about them, talking about them, or thinking about them, did more to keep me going in 2021 than any other in my adult life. My total playtime with games was five times longer in 2021 than it was in 2020. Some of that was coping. Some of it was also keeping my kid engaged when he couldn’t play with his friends. But most of all, it was a way to make a deep connection with the people who made the games through their work, in a year when connection was in short supply.</p>
<p>Here are some of the games of 2021 that did the best job of that.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Astalon-2.jpg?resize=640%2C360"" alt /></p>
<p><strong>My favorite surprise of 2021: <a href=""https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/astalon-tears-of-the-earth-switch/"" target=""_blank""><em>Astalon: Tears of Earth</em></a></strong></p>
<p>I’m a sucker for games that are made by small teams, and they don’t get much smaller than LABS Works. Matt Kap, artist on <em>Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</em> and <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/castle-in-the-darkness-2-is-in-the-works/"" target=""_blank""><em>Castle in the Darkness</em></a>, founded the studio in 2018, and their debut game is a stunner. In a world packed to the gills with indie games of all shapes and sizes, all vying for your attention, <em>Astalon: Tears of Earth</em> humbly plops itself on your lap and says “Hey, remember <em>Xanadu</em>, the Japan-only PC prequel to <em>Faxanadu</em>, which is a weird NES game that you probably don’t remember?” Sadly, most people seem to have answered “No.”</p>
<p>And they’re missing out! But how can I explain that to you with just words? Well, if that <em>Faxanadu</em> reference was lost on you, then maybe you’ve heard of <em>La-Mulana</em>, the notoriously mean Metroidvania series? <em>Astalon</em> is like <em>La-Mulana</em> but fair, and with five distinctly different playable characters that have really fun powers. And it’s got key art by the creator of the 90’s anime series <em>Dragon Half</em>! It’s great stuff! But sadly, it just didn’t stand out for a lot of folks amid <strong>waves hands around furiously</strong> all of this 2021 shit.</p>
<p>I have been following Matt Kap for years, but I may not have known about <em>Astalon</em> if he didn’t cold email me and ask me to play it. As I did, I felt like I was sitting over Matt’s shoulder as he struggled through making the game, grinning big when a particular puzzle really came together and sighing just as big when he hit a major setback on his way to the finish line. For people who love the 8-bit era of sword and sorcery adventure games, <em>Astalon</em> is as authentic a love letter as they come. Anyone who loves the genre is sure to feel just as loved.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sum.jpg?resize=640%2C360"" alt /></p>
<p><strong>My favorite guilt-free game to play with my kid: <a href=""https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/sum-slay-uncool-monsters-switch/"" target=""_blank""><em>S.U.M.</em></a></strong></p>
<p>2021 was the first year that I ever had to teach a child (my son) how to do math. It’s harder than you might think. In a year that was already filled with massive problems to solve, there weren’t many days when, come 7 p.m., my brain was energized with great ideas on how to explain why a “10” is actually “ten ones” and not “a one next to a zero”.  The hardest, and also most interesting, thing about trying to teach a kid something new is you can only rely on the knowledge they already have for context.</p>
<p>You’re also restricted by their limited list of motivations. You can’t squeeze blood from a stone, and you can’t get a person whose brain naturally wanders towards blowing up monsters in <em>Dusk</em> (the boomer shooter) instead of tips and tricks on how to add up to solutions higher than 20. One night he announced “I want a game with monsters, where you don’t see the character you play, and you kill the monsters. That’s all I’m going to do.” He was putting me to task.</p>
<p>After searching the Switch eShop store for a few minutes, I found a game that met his criteria. <em>S.U.M. Slay Uncool Monsters</em> met all his criteria, and it also taught the boy basic addition and subtraction (it also has the option to do multiplication and division, but we’re not there yet). There were many times I wondered if I was making the right choices in 2021. Should I have let him even play a bit of <em>Dusk, No More Heroes 3</em> (with the swears turned off), <em>Axiom Verge 2, and Metroid Dread, </em>or would they give him nightmares for life? Should I have instead been engaging in non-nightmarish, fatherly fun like tossing around the football and telling him about how good vegetables are for his skin? Or is that its own kind of nightmare?</p>
<p>I’ll never know for sure, but I have no doubt that we shared some virtual adventures that we’ll never forget, and that at least one of them made him way better than his friends at basic addition and subtraction.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Metroid-Dread-Central-Unit-Fight.jpg?resize=640%2C360"" alt /></p>
<p><strong>My favorite “It’s great but I wish it was even better” game of 2021: <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-metroid-dread/"" target=""_blank""><em>Metroid Dread</em></a></strong></p>
<p><em>Metroid Dread</em> is the franchise’s <em>Force Awakens</em>. It sticks to the formula to a fault, calling back to all the surface-level things that fans praise in the series while shaving off all the rough edges that may not appeal to modern audiences. The problem for me is, those rough edges are exactly why the series has stuck with me all those years. My ideal<em> Metroid</em> moment-to-moment steps are: 1) Be thrust into an illogical, alien world 2) Get stuck 3) Experiment with new things (tools, techniques, and or strategies) 4) Discover what works 5) Master what you’ve discovered 6) Repeat.</p>
<p>There was definitely some of that in <em>Metroid Dread</em>, but the developers’ urge to turn Samus into “The Badass Action Hero that you know from the<em> Smash Bros.</em> series”  instead of a “plodding, slow jumping astronaut with little mainstream appeal” led <em>Dread</em> to feel more like a 2D <em>Bayonetta</em> title than anything else. And that’s not a bad thing! I really had fun with <em>Dread</em>. It just wasn’t a full return to the things about the series I really love. I didn’t get lost once! Everything was so clearly signposted. I also rarely felt afraid or intimidated. After getting killed by a boss or an E.M.M.I. a few times, their tells and patterns became clear, and they all became pretty easy to beat. And that’s cool! It’s nice to see Samus be fully empowered early on for a change.</p>
<p>It’s also a relief to see her finally win her psychological battles. More so than any other game in the series, <em>Dread</em> shows Samus come to terms with her trauma. In the end, <strong>(Spoilers)</strong> she fully embraces the ways others have altered her, and the rage she feels about it, and masters it all. Self-acceptance is a beautiful thing, and it was very loving of Nintendo and Mercury Steam to want to give that gift, and many others, to their #1 Sci-Fi Action star. It’s just that in order to also make the game a crowd-pleaser, they made <em>Dread</em> a sweet, super-powered breeze instead of the confounding storm of escape rooms that I grew up with.</p>

<p><strong>My “I heard it wasn’t great but it’s actually amazing” game of 2021: <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-skatebird/"" target=""_blank""><em>SkateBIRD</em></a></strong></p>
<p>When you love someone, their imperfections look beautiful. You can see why other people may not feel the same way about them, but you wouldn’t change them for the world. That’s how I feel about <em>SkateBIRD</em>. I get that, especially pre-patch, the game felt chunky and tough to grasp. But that’s exactly how real skateboarding feels for me, a 45-year old man who has definitely ollied once, but it was a long time ago. Even then, it really may have been more of a half-olly that mostly failed. At this point, who’s to say?</p>
<p><em>SkateBIRD</em> embraces that kind of subjectivity. Come to think of it, there are a few ways that it feels more like classic <em>Metroid</em> than even <em>Dread</em> does. Instead of being a human with bird alien DNA trying to navigate through a bird alien hideout, you’re a bird wearing people clothes trying to do people things. The world of humans is not built for you, but with the right mix of tenacity and curiosity, you can go places you never thought possible, pulling off moves once thought unthinkable.</p>
<p>And that soundtrack! Imagine the music from <em>Jet Set Radio</em>, but with samples of bird-obsessed scientists awing at a majestic <a href=""https://madsenstudios.bandcamp.com/track/the-heron"" target=""_blank"">Heron Gull one minute</a>, and a confident young lad declaring that <a href=""https://wearetheunion.bandcamp.com/track/goin-down-the-road-feelin-bad"" target=""_blank"">the president is a racist transphobe</a> the next. It’s truly an album for the ages.</p>

<p><strong>My favorite “I heard it was bad but I wish it was even worse” game of 2021: <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-ps5-version/"" target=""_blank""><em>GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition</em></a></strong></p>
<p>I cannot legitimately enjoy the <em>GTA</em> series. I have tried and tried, but on the whole, they just feel bad. I don’t think I would like the people that came up with them. It feels like they don’t even like video games that much. Sure, they like what games can <em>do</em>, but instead of embracing the surreality, the creativity, and the heart of the medium, they just want to recreate Quentin Tarantino’s ’90s movies. They want to let you be a sociopath who… loves to explore? I don’t get it. Playing 3D <em>GTA</em> games feels like working a boring-but-demanding job for asshole bosses, all at the cost of doing anything worthwhile with your time (and from some accounts, <a href=""https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-10-26-rockstars-broken-work-ethics"" target=""_blank"">making them feel that way too</a>.)</p>
<p>Of course, I’ve felt pretty alone with that opinion for the past 20 years or so. For a long time, it felt like there were two kinds of people in this world; the ones who steer clear of “<em>Grand Theft Auto</em>” because it sounds like a deep dive into the dank dumpster of our collective cultural consciousness, and the ones who can’t wait to take that dip. The folks in the first group usually think all video games are trash. That’s definitely not me. The folks in the second group usually have an attraction to being the “bad guy” in games. That’s not me either! So that’s been my pickle for the past two decades.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/face.jpg?resize=640%2C360"" alt /></p>
<p>For the record, I also like the<em> Star Wars</em> prequels, hate <em>Space Jam</em>, and think that the N64 is Nintendo’s worst console by a country mile. For a long time, people thought I was a dunce for these opinions as well, but for whatever reason, time seems to have brought many over to my way of thinking. Apparently, the prequels are cool again,<em> Space Jam</em> is largely recognized to be an overwrought McDonald’s commercial, and people think N64 games look terrible! Welcome to my brain, everyone!</p>
<p>And that’s exactly how I felt when I saw how much people hated the recently released <em>GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition</em>. “Hey, this game looks like crap…” Yeah, they always have! “These missions are repetitive and dull…” Yes! Always has been again! “The rain in this game looks like bukkake…”</p>
<p>Well, that one’s new, but it’s definitely still on-brand.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rain.webp?resize=640%2C360"" alt /></p>
<p>These three remastered <em>GTA</em> games looked like cheap cash grabs, unloved and uncared about. That felt honest to me. A series about stealing stuff for easy money was trying to get away with a criminally shitty “definitive” version of their “classic titles”. Even better, they were so broken that they finally felt like video games again. Human faces suddenly appear in walls, cars grow to massive sizes for no reason, and people trash-talk before blasting off into space. Purely by accident, <em>GTA</em> had finally gotten weird and silly, and had become a worthwhile self-parody in the process. I was ready to buy the physical Switch port (the <em>most</em> broken version) on day one, just for laughs.</p>
<p>Then it was delayed indefinitely, as the publisher was surely aghast at these games finally getting the low review scores they always deserved. It’s a bummer that, after <em>GTA</em> finally went to being “so bad it’s good” from “so bad it’s boring” that Rockstar is undoubtedly trying to make them blander again. But who knows, maybe they will go full Cruelty Squad with the Switch port when it’s finally sold on the cartridge. One can hope.</p>

<p><strong>My favorite small game of the year: <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-mon-amour-nintendo-switch-pc/"" target=""_blank""><em>Mon Amour</em></a></strong></p>
<p>At the same time, I was feeling alone with my dislike of the <em>GTA</em> games on the PS2, I was falling in love with another open-world game on the console: <em>Chulip</em>, the exploration and kissing game. It was everything that <em>GTA</em> wasn’t: cute, funny, kind, and quick to punish you for stepping out of line. And in this game, you’re in line for a smooch!</p>
<p>Once again, history has proven my weird taste in games to be the correct one. <em>Chulip</em> is now worth a bunch of money on the resale market, and people much smarter and more interesting than I talk about how great it is all the time. The creator of the game has taken notice as well. His latest game, <em>Mon Amour</em>, returns to <em>Chulip</em>‘s smooching concept but makes it a simple <em>Flappy Bird-</em>esque arcade game. That doesn’t sound that great, does it? But it is! The music, the graphics, the comedy, all top-notch, but my favorite thing about the game is the way if feels. In real life, it’s hard to know if you’re doing things right, and that goes double for moving in for your first kiss. <em>Mon Amour</em> replicates that feeling of “moving forward cautiously, following your instincts, but ready to fail at any moment” perfectly. Subjectively, it’s perfect.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AV2.jpg?resize=640%2C320"" alt /></p>
<p><strong>My favorite medium-sized game of 2021: <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-axiom-verge-2/"" target=""_blank""><em>Axiom Verge 2</em></a></strong></p>
<p><em>Axiom Verge 2</em> is also about boldly moving into the unknown. At the start, it’s not a lot like the first game, eschewing old-school <em>Metroid</em> aesthetics for a more athletic, organic exercise. It’s about a new lead character doing new things in a new place, and while lore-hounds for the first game will find plenty of allusions to the original, this game definitely didn’t need to be called <em>Axiom Verge 2</em>. In fact, calling it that was a pretty big risk, at least from a marketing perspective. But the risk paid off, and in the end, it makes sense.</p>
<p>Just as the original <em>Axiom Verge</em> was, intentionally or not, an accurate reflection of the one-person development team’s psyche, the sequel catches us up with where Tom Happ, the creator of the franchise, is in his life today. He’s a dad now, working to create both a good life for his kid with one hand and to make even better games than he has before with the other. The path to meet both goals is indelibly intertwined. He can’t make money for his family if he doesn’t make good games, and he can’t make good games unless he creates honest work that could only come from him.</p>
<p>I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entirety of my playtime with <em>Axiom Verge 2</em>, waiting to see exactly if, and how, Tom would pull off this dual aim. In the end, he nailed it. My only complaint about the game is there isn’t more of it. When the credits finally rolled, I was not ready to quit. Then again, that’s true of just about every one of the games on this list. Thankfully, most of them are sure to get some sort of sequel and/or DLC expansion at some point. They all did pretty well, so we probably won’t have to say goodbye to them anytime soon.</p>

<p><strong>My favorite big game of 2021: <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-no-more-heroes-3/"" target=""_blank""><em>No More Heroes 3</em></a></strong></p>
<p>I can’t believe this is goodbye! <em>No More Heroes 3</em> has so many hints of where the series could go from here, from movie adaptations by Takashi Miike to <em>Back to the Future</em>-style forays into the far-flung foibles of Travis’s offspring. <strong>(SPOILERS)</strong> I mean, he cuts his brother in half, and like five minutes later, is decapitated by him! And we still don’t know exactly how why! This can’t be the end, can it?</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>In retrospect, you can tell Suda51 was planning to make this the last game in the series. Last episodes of TV shows often swing for the fences in the same way. For a series, all the episodes before the final one have a specific job to do; to get you to want to watch the next one. The last episode doesn’t have to pursue the audience in the same way. It exists in a time where there’s no tomorrow.</p>

<p>For <em>Quantum Leap</em>, that meant capping things off with a bunch of small talk among characters you’d never seen before. For Jim Henson’s <em>Dinosaurs</em>, it meant bringing a heavenly Apocolypse down to Earth. For <em>No More Heroes 3</em>, it meant all that and more. We’ve heard that even more magic was planned for the game, and fans will always wonder what could have been, but there is no doubting that this is the fullest, most fun entry in the series. Just as our old pal <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoQ1PjMdCeE"" target=""_blank"">Jirard “The Completionist” Khalil</a>. He put hundreds of hours into the game and is one of the few people in the world to truly see it all.</p>
<p>Someday, I might see it all too. <em>No More Heroes 3</em> is a game I plan to play for the rest of my days. It’s broken in all the right ways while fixing all of the things that were less than perfect about its predecessors. More importantly, it loves <em>No More Heroes, </em>and its fans, with all its heart. In a year where it was easy to lose sight of what was good, games like this reminded me why I love the medium, and I’m grateful for it.</p>

Bad year, great games
Hey kids! I hope you had a fun and frisky 2021. I guess it’s possible that you did, but for most of us, it was pretty torturous. I know I shouldn’t complain. No one close to me got super sick, I kept my job, and despite the constant stress and drain that came from maintaining in the midst of year two of a global pandemic, I still managed to get a bunch of cool projects done. I even have a sheep named after me in The Good Life.
But I also shouldn’t pretend to be happy with 2021 when I’m not. This year was disillusioning, both in and out of the games industry. Many great titles were relatively ignored while mostly-worthless trends like NFTs seemed to be everywhere. Tons of people in power throughout the industry were revealed to have done terrible things. And to cap it all off, the CEO of Square Enix capped off the year by saying that he wants to move in a “games are not for fun” direction. The cream was sinking to the bottom while the turds rose to the top. It’s enough to make you want to throw in the blood-soaked, stinking towel.
But there were many, many games that kept that towel soft and warm. Just playing games, as opposed to writing about them, talking about them, or thinking about them, did more to keep me going in 2021 than any other in my adult life. My total playtime with games was five times longer in 2021 than it was in 2020. Some of that was coping. Some of it was also keeping my kid engaged when he couldn’t play with his friends. But most of all, it was a way to make a deep connection with the people who made the games through their work, in a year when connection was in short supply.
Here are some of the games of 2021 that did the best job of that.

My favorite surprise of 2021: Astalon: Tears of Earth
I’m a sucker for games that are made by small teams, and they don’t get much smaller than LABS Works. Matt Kap, artist on Binding of Isaac: Rebirth and Castle in the Darkness, founded the studio in 2018, and their debut game is a stunner. In a world packed to the gills with indie games of all shapes and sizes, all vying for your attention, Astalon: Tears of Earth humbly plops itself on your lap and says “Hey, remember Xanadu, the Japan-only PC prequel to Faxanadu, which is a weird NES game that you probably don’t remember?” Sadly, most people seem to have answered “No.”
And they’re missing out! But how can I explain that to you with just words? Well, if that Faxanadu reference was lost on you, then maybe you’ve heard of La-Mulana, the notoriously mean Metroidvania series? Astalon is like La-Mulana but fair, and with five distinctly different playable characters that have really fun powers. And it’s got key art by the creator of the 90’s anime series Dragon Half! It’s great stuff! But sadly, it just didn’t stand out for a lot of folks amid waves hands around furiously all of this 2021 shit.
I have been following Matt Kap for years, but I may not have known about Astalon if he didn’t cold email me and ask me to play it. As I did, I felt like I was sitting over Matt’s shoulder as he struggled through making the game, grinning big when a particular puzzle really came together and sighing just as big when he hit a major setback on his way to the finish line. For people who love the 8-bit era of sword and sorcery adventure games, Astalon is as authentic a love letter as they come. Anyone who loves the genre is sure to feel just as loved.

My favorite guilt-free game to play with my kid: S.U.M.
2021 was the first year that I ever had to teach a child (my son) how to do math. It’s harder than you might think. In a year that was already filled with massive problems to solve, there weren’t many days when, come 7 p.m., my brain was energized with great ideas on how to explain why a “10” is actually “ten ones” and not “a one next to a zero”.  The hardest, and also most interesting, thing about trying to teach a kid something new is you can only rely on the knowledge they already have for context.
You’re also restricted by their limited list of motivations. You can’t squeeze blood from a stone, and you can’t get a person whose brain naturally wanders towards blowing up monsters in Dusk (the boomer shooter) instead of tips and tricks on how to add up to solutions higher than 20. One night he announced “I want a game with monsters, where you don’t see the character you play, and you kill the monsters. That’s all I’m going to do.” He was putting me to task.
After searching the Switch eShop store for a few minutes, I found a game that met his criteria. S.U.M. Slay Uncool Monsters met all his criteria, and it also taught the boy basic addition and subtraction (it also has the option to do multiplication and division, but we’re not there yet). There were many times I wondered if I was making the right choices in 2021. Should I have let him even play a bit of Dusk, No More Heroes 3 (with the swears turned off), Axiom Verge 2, and Metroid Dread, or would they give him nightmares for life? Should I have instead been engaging in non-nightmarish, fatherly fun like tossing around the football and telling him about how good vegetables are for his skin? Or is that its own kind of nightmare?
I’ll never know for sure, but I have no doubt that we shared some virtual adventures that we’ll never forget, and that at least one of them made him way better than his friends at basic addition and subtraction.

My favorite “It’s great but I wish it was even better” game of 2021: Metroid Dread
Metroid Dread is the franchise’s Force Awakens. It sticks to the formula to a fault, calling back to all the surface-level things that fans praise in the series while shaving off all the rough edges that may not appeal to modern audiences. The problem for me is, those rough edges are exactly why the series has stuck with me all those years. My ideal Metroid moment-to-moment steps are: 1) Be thrust into an illogical, alien world 2) Get stuck 3) Experiment with new things (tools, techniques, and or strategies) 4) Discover what works 5) Master what you’ve discovered 6) Repeat.
There was definitely some of that in Metroid Dread, but the developers’ urge to turn Samus into “The Badass Action Hero that you know from the Smash Bros. series”  instead of a “plodding, slow jumping astronaut with little mainstream appeal” led Dread to feel more like a 2D Bayonetta title than anything else. And that’s not a bad thing! I really had fun with Dread. It just wasn’t a full return to the things about the series I really love. I didn’t get lost once! Everything was so clearly signposted. I also rarely felt afraid or intimidated. After getting killed by a boss or an E.M.M.I. a few times, their tells and patterns became clear, and they all became pretty easy to beat. And that’s cool! It’s nice to see Samus be fully empowered early on for a change.
It’s also a relief to see her finally win her psychological battles. More so than any other game in the series, Dread shows Samus come to terms with her trauma. In the end, (Spoilers) she fully embraces the ways others have altered her, and the rage she feels about it, and masters it all. Self-acceptance is a beautiful thing, and it was very loving of Nintendo and Mercury Steam to want to give that gift, and many others, to their #1 Sci-Fi Action star. It’s just that in order to also make the game a crowd-pleaser, they made Dread a sweet, super-powered breeze instead of the confounding storm of escape rooms that I grew up with.

My “I heard it wasn’t great but it’s actually amazing” game of 2021: SkateBIRD
When you love someone, their imperfections look beautiful. You can see why other people may not feel the same way about them, but you wouldn’t change them for the world. That’s how I feel about SkateBIRD. I get that, especially pre-patch, the game felt chunky and tough to grasp. But that’s exactly how real skateboarding feels for me, a 45-year old man who has definitely ollied once, but it was a long time ago. Even then, it really may have been more of a half-olly that mostly failed. At this point, who’s to say?
SkateBIRD embraces that kind of subjectivity. Come to think of it, there are a few ways that it feels more like classic Metroid than even Dread does. Instead of being a human with bird alien DNA trying to navigate through a bird alien hideout, you’re a bird wearing people clothes trying to do people things. The world of humans is not built for you, but with the right mix of tenacity and curiosity, you can go places you never thought possible, pulling off moves once thought unthinkable.
And that soundtrack! Imagine the music from Jet Set Radio, but with samples of bird-obsessed scientists awing at a majestic Heron Gull one minute, and a confident young lad declaring that the president is a racist transphobe the next. It’s truly an album for the ages.

My favorite “I heard it was bad but I wish it was even worse” game of 2021: GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition
I cannot legitimately enjoy the GTA series. I have tried and tried, but on the whole, they just feel bad. I don’t think I would like the people that came up with them. It feels like they don’t even like video games that much.

But who knows, maybe they will go full Cruelty Squad with the Switch port when it’s finally sold on the cartridge. One can hope.

My favorite small game of the year: Mon Amour
At the same time, I was feeling alone with my dislike of the GTA games on the PS2, I was falling in love with another open-world game on the console: Chulip, the exploration and kissing game. It was everything that GTA wasn’t: cute, funny, kind, and quick to punish you for stepping out of line. And in this game, you’re in line for a smooch!

Mon Amour replicates that feeling of “moving forward cautiously, following your instincts, but ready to fail at any moment” perfectly. Subjectively, it’s perfect.

It exists in a time where there’s no tomorrow.

For Quantum Leap, that meant capping things off with a bunch of small talk among characters you’d never seen before. For Jim Henson’s Dinosaurs, it meant bringing a heavenly Apocolypse down to Earth. For No More Heroes 3, it meant all that and more. We’ve heard that even more magic was planned for the game, and fans will always wonder what could have been, but there is no doubting that this is the fullest, most fun entry in the series. Just as our old pal Jirard “The Completionist” Khalil. He put hundreds of hours into the game and is one of the few people in the world to truly see it all.
Someday, I might see it all too. No More Heroes 3 is a game I plan to play for the rest of my days. It’s broken in all the right ways while fixing all of the things that were less than perfect about its predecessors. More importantly, it loves No More Heroes, and its fans, with all its heart. In a year where it was easy to lose sight of what was good, games like this reminded me why I love the medium, and I’m grateful for it.

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

The legendary is your “partner” and will allow you to explore the map
Thanks to a new Pokemon Presents stream, we have new info on some Pokemon Scarlet and Violet features.
Nothing in terms of major bombshells dropped, but there’s plenty of stuff for fans to unpack. The narrative includes “attending an academy as a student,” with the core objective of embarking upon a treasure hunt with “three grand stories.” Of course, one of them is a series of classic gym battles.
Legendaries can be used as mounts, with “sprinting or drive mode” for land travel, “swimming and aquatic” for sea, and “gliding build/glide mode” in the air. You’re encouraged to “ride your Legendary Pokemon to traverse the expansive Paldea region and explore every nook and cranny together.”

Multiplayer was a big focus of the trailer too. The “union circle” enables co-op for “up to three friends.” You can run around the map together, and footage showed everyone riding their legendary mounts. Tera raid battles are in, borrowing a feature from Pokemon Sword and Shield: up to three other players are supported here too.
Named cast members include:

Professors Sada and Turo (which change depending on the version, previously confirmed)
Clavell (director of the academy – their suit seems to change colors based on the version too)
Jacq (homeroom teacher of biology)
Nemona (your friend, previously confirmed)
Arven (upperclassman and cook)
Penny (a shy student)
Grusha (ice gym leader)

Named Pokemon shown off in the new footage include the following:

Wooper (new Paldean form) — “Their bodies are heavy and they move slowly, but they can protect themselves by shooting powerful poisonous liquid from their gills.”
Fidough — “When these Pokémon become excited, they intimidate their opponents by puffing up their bodies to appear bigger.”
Cetitan — “Cetitan need to have tough muscles to be able to support their immense bodies, and physical attacks using their bodies have incredible power.”

A gem-like form called the “Terastallizing” mechanic will be part of the new Scarlet and Violet festivities, which “boost Pokemon types, and make their moves stronger.” Every Pokemon can apparently do this, and it can even change their types. An example given was a normal Eevee type that “could” change into grass or water type after Terastallizing. There will be “Pokemon with rare tera types.” As usual, like Z-Moves/Megas and all of their ilk, I expect this to be divisive. Officially, it’s known as the “Terastal phenomenon.”

City Connection has noted that Akai Katana Shin will support multiple languages, including English, French, and Spanish.
Akai Katana Shin launches December 15 on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. A physical release will follow in 2023 on PS4 and Nintendo Switch only.

<h2>It was the blurst of times…</h2>
<p>Publisher Raw Fury, in association with developer Fury Studios, has opened up its neon yellow bum-bag and pulled out a teaser for the next entry in the strategy/building <em>Kingdom</em> series: <em>Kingdom Eighties.</em></p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/srq0fgpX9F0?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>Currently in development for “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srq0fgpX9F0"" target=""_blank"">the coolest platforms</a>,” <em>Kingdom Eighties: Summer of Greed</em> will see that series visit the manic, Day-Glo vibe of 1980s Americana, utilizing a wild, Saturday Morning Show vibe to backdrop its latest bout of exploration, world-building, and conquest. While Raw Fury is keeping tight-lipped on the details, we do know that the premise of <em>Kingdom Eighties</em> concerns a rag-tag gang of kids and their efforts to save their neighborhood from the mysterious and titular “Greed.”</p>
<p>The new game will represent the fourth release in the franchise, following on from <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-kingdom/"" target=""_blank""><em>Kingdom</em></a> (2015), <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-kingdom-new-lands/"" target=""_blank""><em>Kingdom: New Lands</em></a> (2016), and <a href=""https://www.pcinvasion.com/kingdom-two-crowns-norse-lands/"" target=""_blank""><em>Kingdom: Two Crowns</em></a> (2018). The new game will retain all of the resource-management, base-building, and combat of its predecessors, but is simply choosing to set the action in an entirely new world, one of arcade games, weekend adventures, and <em>Denver the Last Dinosaur</em>. Just remember to trade in your trusty steed for a BMX and you’ll be golden.</p>
<p><em>Kingdom Eighties</em> is currently in development for PC and consoles. It is scheduled to launch in 2022.</p>

		<h2>CMA filings show how the Activision Blizzard deal could help build the Xbox mobile store</h2>
<p>Amid investigations over Microsoft’s <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-purchase-acquisition-call-of-duty-warcraft/"" target=""_blank"">possible acquisition</a> of Activision Blizzard, new details have emerged about its plans for a mobile store to compete with other platforms.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal is <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-under-uk-regulator-investigation-news/"" target=""_blank"">under investigation</a> by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). As part of those filings, Microsoft says a motivation for the acquisition is to help build out its mobile presence.</p>
<p>Here’s the relevant item from <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/microsoft-slash-activision-blizzard-merger-inquiry"" target=""_blank"">the CMA filing</a>, as reported on by <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/19/23411972/microsoft-xbox-mobile-store-games"" target=""_blank"">The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The transaction will improve Microsoft’s ability to create a next generation game store which operates across a range of devices, including mobile as a result of the addition of Activision Blizzard’s content. Building on Activision Blizzard’s existing communities of gamers, Xbox will seek to scale the Xbox Store to mobile, attracting gamers to a new Xbox Mobile Platform. Shifting consumers away from the Google Play Store and App Store on mobile devices will, however, require a major shift in consumer behavior. Microsoft hopes that by offering well-known and popular content, gamers will be more inclined to try something new.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Microsoft has been pushing more and more into the mobile market. Putting its <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-ios-pc-browser-game-pass-ultimate/"" target=""_blank"">cloud gaming service</a> on phones makes for pretty good reasons to pick up a controller clip and game on the go.</p>

<h2>Ok, Computer?</h2>
<p>The KID A MNESIA Exhibition, <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/kid-a-mnesia-radiohead-ps5-trailer-playstation-showcase/"" target=""_blank"">an experimental celebration</a> of the work of legendary British rock band Radiohead, will launch on PC and PS5 November 18, as announced by collective [namethemachine], Arbitrarily Good Productions, and Epic Games. Fans will be able to download the exhibition,  free of charge, from PlayStation Store and Epic Games Store.</p>

<p>The strange endeavor, curated by Radiohead singer Thom Yorke and artist Stanley Donwood, is officially described as “a fevered dream-space, an edifice, built from the art and creatures, words and recordings of Radiohead’s Kid A and Amnesiac uncovered from 20 odd years ago, reassembled and given new mutant life.” Which is, by far, a better explanation for the event than yer boy Moyse can put together, based on the curiously obscure trailers for the project.</p>
<p>The exhibition has been curated to celebrate the 21st anniversary of Radiohead’s fourth and fifth studio albums — <em>Kid A</em> and <em>Amnesiac</em>, respectively. The show will feature visuals, sounds, and artwork taken from and inspired by the two recordings, as well as deconstructed tracks and newly released music that has been pulled from the original recording’s master tapes. The long and short of it is: If you’re a Radiohead fan, you’ll definitely want to check out the action.</p>
<p>Originally designed as a physical installation, with plans to travel between various capital cities across the globe, the KID A MNESIA project was transitioned into digital form after the COVID-19 outbreak made frequent and easy travel nigh-on impossible.

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

<h2>Merrie Melodies</h2>
<p>Yesterday, Warner Bros. Games <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-open-beta-is-now-live-on-playstation-pc-and-xbox/"" target=""_blank"">launched the open beta</a> for its incoming platform fighter <em><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-beta-platform-fighter-impressions/"" target=""_blank"">MultiVersus</a>,</em> allowing players on both PC and console platforms to step into the ring with its crossover cast of pop culture characters. Already, the <em>MultiVersus </em>beta has seen incredible success, becoming the fourth most popular title on just the Steam platform alone.</p>
<p>The PC dashboard logged <a href=""https://steamcharts.com/app/1818750"" target=""_blank"">an incredible 144,000 players at its peak</a> yesterday, surpassing launch day numbers for any other fighting game on the platform — including <em>Street Fighter, Tekken</em>, and <em>Mortal Kombat.</em> It should be noted, of course, that <em>MultiVersus</em> is a free-to-play title, but that’s still a staggering amount of players. When you add in players on Xbox and PlayStation, we could easily be looking at the most popular fighting game beta of all time.</p>

<p>Of course, these numbers lead to some particularly sweaty servers, and some players found themselves struggling to log in during Tuesday’s peak activity period. A fighting game lives and dies on the longevity of its community, so while these numbers are unlikely to be retained, <em>MultiVersus</em> will be looking to hook in enough regulars to keep the fists and fur flying over the coming weeks, months, and perhaps years — though Player First Games’ implementation of crossplay will certainly aid this goal.</p>
<p>If you want to check out the slapstick silliness for yourself, then the<em> MultiVersus</em> beta is available on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms right now. All you need do is download the game client on your platform of choice, sign in with a WB Games account, and you’re ready to rock. The “full” version of <em>MultiVersus</em> will launch later in 2022.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<h2><em>Gotham Knights</em> is out on October 25, 2022</h2>
<p>This morning, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/new-gotham-knights-update-may-2022/"">as promised</a>, WB Games has unveiled <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/GothamKnights"">more info on <em>Gotham Knights</em></a>, and we finally have a release date folks! October 25, 2022. So here’s a particularly interesting tidbit: a WB Games rep has informed Destructoid that “in order to provide players with the best possible gameplay experience, the game will release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, and <strong>will not be available for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles</strong>. Yep, that’s the <em>Gotham Knights</em> current gen situation, and every single era elicits its own set of polarizing responses to the news depending on the timing.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/aSZN_a9bu8Q?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>On one hand, this is a way for WB to “cleverly” charge $70 for the standard edition since it’s current gen only. On the other, a lot of folks who actually own a PS5 and Xbox Series X have been waiting for the “next gen” to actually arrive outside of a select few PS5 exclusives. That time has come: at least for <em>Gotham Knights</em>. Today, the big reveal is gameplay of Nightwing and Red Hood — a regular old set of Robins — as they take on the Court of Owls, one of the more semi-recent (as far as <em>Batman</em> has been around) popular rogue groups in Batman’s gallery. You can watch that below!</p>
<p>The 13-minute video is a pure walkthrough, complete with voiceover. It showcases Nightwing and Red Hood’s abilities: the latter of which uses “non-lethal rounds,” which still lets the creators get away with having a hero who dual-wields pistols. The best part of the video is that it’s two-player co-op, so you can see how multiplayer will flow, as well as the team-up system. The UI will be customizable, and we get to see a bit of Belfry (hub) gameplay, where you’ll choose story missions (you can fast travel into the open world from it), upgrade loadouts (through the workbench), and watch some cutscenes play out.</p>

<p>And of course, the price tags are public knowledge now too:</p>
<ul>
<li>G<em>otham Knights </em>Standard Edition ($69.99)</li>
<li><em>Gotham Knights</em> Deluxe Edition ($89.99 – with the base game, the Visionary Pack DLC, “exclusive gear and cosmetics,” Beyond Suitstyle character skins inspired by the animated series, “and more”)</li>

<h2>The Great Mouse Adventurer is back for a sequel</h2>
<p>The first game shown during today’s State of Play stream was none other than <em>Moss: Book II</em>, a sequel to the PlayStation VR action-adventure title fans have been expecting from developer Polyarc for some time now. As a guardian overseer, you’ll help Quill fight and puzzle her way through a fantasy landscape. It’s already adorable, as you’d expect.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/x8HvWj2sMeY?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-moss/"" target=""_blank"">It’s been three years</a>, so I’ll need a refresher on the first outing, but I was enthusiastic about <em>Moss</em> back then and there’s definitely room for more of those cute mousy action-adventuring vibes. I mean, that game even ended with a “Book I” cliffhanger! “Quill accomplishes what she set out to do, but her story feels like it’s only just begun,” I wrote at the time. It’s one of my favorites in the PlayStation VR library.</p>
<p>The sequel has “new mechanics, environments, enemies, and abilities,” <a href=""https://blog.playstation.com/2021/07/08/quills-epic-adventure-continues-in-moss-book-ii-coming-to-ps-vr/"" target=""_blank"">says</a> principal engineer and design director Joshua Stiksma. “Along with new weapons like the hammer and nature attunement ability for creating new pathways for exploration, we were excited to build upon the player’s ability to charge Quill’s weapons. This not only provides Quill unique ways to solve puzzles, uncover secrets, and defeat enemies, but it feels really good to be able to reach out and connect with her through that kind of teamwork.”</p>
<p><em>Moss: Book II</em> is “currently in development for PSVR.” I’ll be ready for that next-generation <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/sony-has-revealed-its-vr-controllers-for-ps5-and-they-look-kinda-funky/"" target=""_blank"">PS5 VR headset</a> and its new controllers whenever the day comes.</p>

The first game shown during today’s State of Play stream was none other than Moss: Book II, a sequel to the PlayStation VR action-adventure title fans have been expecting from developer Polyarc for some time now. As a guardian overseer, you’ll help Quill fight and puzzle her way through a fantasy landscape. It’s already adorable, as you’d expect.

It’s been three years, so I’ll need a refresher on the first outing, but I was enthusiastic about Moss back then and there’s definitely room for more of those cute mousy action-adventuring vibes. I mean, that game even ended with a “Book I” cliffhanger! “Quill accomplishes what she set out to do, but her story feels like it’s only just begun,” I wrote at the time. It’s one of my favorites in the PlayStation VR library.
The sequel has “new mechanics, environments, enemies, and abilities,” says principal engineer and design director Joshua Stiksma. “Along with new weapons like the hammer and nature attunement ability for creating new pathways for exploration, we were excited to build upon the player’s ability to charge Quill’s weapons. This not only provides Quill unique ways to solve puzzles, uncover secrets, and defeat enemies, but it feels really good to be able to reach out and connect with her through that kind of teamwork.”
Moss: Book II is “currently in development for PSVR.” I’ll be ready for that next-generation PS5 VR headset and its new controllers whenever the day comes.

<p><sub>[Destructoid user <strong>Moths</strong> is here to suggest that the world could use more games like <em>Simon’s Quest</em>, and for as bewildering as it can be even <em>with</em> a well-laid-out walkthrough, I can’t say I disagree. It’s a strange gem, one that sticks with you. -Jordan]<br /></sub></p>
<p>I recently replayed <em>Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest</em> for the first time in years. Coming into it a little older and a lot more pretentious, I was struck by what a special kind of game it is. It is a failure, yes. There have been plenty of those since 1987. But it is a failure that had stood the test of time. One that has earned love and a place in history largely on the merits of its failings. This honestly hits me at a personal level. I can only <em>dream</em> of one day becoming an interesting failure.</p>
<p><em>Simon’s Quest </em>falls between the original <em>Castlevania </em>and <em>Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse</em>. It represents a wild detour in the progression between those two games. It moved the focus away from a traditional action-platforming style and onto adventure elements, with progress being gated more by exploration and puzzles than by challenge. There’s a day/night cycle, and rudimentary experience and inventory systems. Grinding for currency is a relevant part of the game, but getting knocked into pits by medusa heads is not. Any player with the knowledge of how to do so can stomp Dracula to pieces in a few seconds. The knowledge of how to get that far in the first place is the hard part. And so on.</p>
<p>In short, it’s a complete reversal of the things that make its immediate neighbours tick. That’s pretty interesting! Not many sequels are so bold, nor have their boldness so immediately undone. The trouble is that none of it actually works very well. The developers were attempting to coax the NES, the <em>Castlevania</em> framework, and themselves into doing things that they just couldn’t quite do. To put it more bluntly, it is frequently laborious, runs poorly, and makes no sense.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/446572-622200-CV22jpg-noscale.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""Nothing is as it seems in Simon's Quest."" /></p>
<p>The result is a sort of surreal anti-game, half-dressed in the trappings of a traditional classic.</p>
<p>None of the normal rules seem to apply. Boss fights present no challenge, and death means nothing. Dungeons contain huge dead ends – <em>actual </em>dead ends, the kind that there is no reason to visit and that you almost never see in games. Sometimes you just have to go a different way. Sometimes you have to jump through a wall that isn’t actually there, but looks just like all the ones that are. It’s a distant precursor to <em>Souls</em>’ illusory walls, I suppose. But these ones are mandatory.</p>
<p>Puzzles… aren’t. Not in the prevailing sense of the word. They feel all but completely arbitrary in both narrative and mechanical terms. A greyscale man will trade you a red crystal for a blue one. You can then hold the red crystal and kneel in front of a cliff, and a whirlwind will appear to carry you up to the top. Garlic can be purchased from a man in a hidden basement, then taken to a cemetery and thrown on the ground so that another man will appear and give you a silk bag. It’s a whole lot of ‘what’ with a giddy dearth of ‘why’. There are hints available through dialogue and hidden throughout the game, but these serve more as another layer of oddness than as a guide. Indeed, many are outright lies.</p>

<p>The whole thing creates an alien, frustrating, deeply charming sense of something that barely knows how to be a video game, but isn’t going to let that stop it.</p>
<p>Having this oddity squelching about in the middle of a retro dynasty like <em>Castlevania </em>really resonates with me, and I get the impression that I’m not alone in that. When <em>Simon’s Quest </em>comes up, people rush to its quirks: the stilted poetry of its translations, the meekness of its final battle, the act of kneeling in front of that cliff for just long enough that you begin to wonder if you’re doing it right before it works. These things stick with people. They’re memorable, and they’re memorably unlike the feeling that most games create. It is a game of non sequiturs and anti-climaxes. Those are taboo in this medium. And it isn’t just that <em>Simon’s Quest </em>breaks that taboo – it’s that it doesn’t even seem to notice it.</p>
<p>And that’s my best attempt at talking about <em>Simon’s Quest</em>. A sort of backhanded love letter, I guess. All comments always welcome. A parting note: <em>Castlevania III</em> is almost universally considered a better game than <em>Castlevania II</em>, and I can’t disagree with that in good conscience. But I will say that the world needs <em>Simon’s Quest</em>s more than it needs <em>Castlevania III</em>s.</p>

World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King Classic launches globally today and Destructoid sister site Icy Veins is here to tell you all about it, including an assortment of guides.
Global Release Times
Wrath Classic launches in the Americas, Europe, Taiwan, Korea, and Australia/New Zealand simultaneously. Check the details below for the exact time you can log in to the game and explore all that the new expansion has to offer.

What’s New?

New Continent: Northrend – Heroes will begin their journey in one of two zones in Northrend — Borean Tundra or Howling Fjord. A vast new continent awaits!
New Hero Class: Death Knights – Available to both factions at Level 55, Death Knights harness the powers of darkness to help combat the evil that threatens Azeroth. In Wrath Classic, Blizard is bypassing the requirement for a player’s first Death Knight character, unless they decide to pick a fresh realm.
New Profession: Inscription – Scribe mystical glyphs that modify the properties of spells and abilities or create powerful trinkets and off-hand items.
Achievements – Show off your accomplishments and earn various rewards in WoW Classic!
Dungeons &amp; Raids – Multiple new dungeons and 3 raids will be available during Phase 1.

Wrath of the Lich King Classic is included with existing World of Warcraft subscriptions. If you subscribe to World of Warcraft, you can also play Wrath of the Lich King Classic at no additional cost.

New Hero Class: Death Knight
Death Knights are a new Hero Class available in Wrath Classic. They start at Level 55 in Ebon Hold and have 3 specializations to choose from: Blood, Frost, and Unholy. You do not need an existing Level 55 character on the same realm to create your first Death Knight in Wrath Classic. Fresh start realms are an exception to the rule. Any Death Knight created after your first one must be on a different realm, and requires an existing Level 55 character on the same realm. Completing the Death Knight intro in Wrath Classic rewards the Frostbrood Proto-Wyrm mount on live servers.
If you’re playing a Death Knight in Wrath Classic, we have a set of guides specifically tailored to help you with leveling, gearing, talents, addons, and macros.
Death Knight PvE &amp; PvP Guides
Death Knight Gear Guides
Talent Guides
Inscription is a new Profession that lets you craft powerful items called glyphs that enhance spells and abilities. Scribes can create various trinkets and off-hand items.


We’ve all been there! It is always difficult to choose a class, especially in an MMORPG like World of Warcraft, and when you finally decide which class to play, it’s time to start leveling! The cap has been raised to Level 80 in Wrath Classic (up from Level 70 in Burning Crusade Classic).
If you do not plan on maining a Death Knight, we have leveling guides for other classes as well with recommended builds and talents.

<h2>Shoring up the game before the DLC drops</h2>
<p>As soon as I heard that the escape-room puzzle adventure game <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/escape-academy-co-op-solo-impressions-puzzle-game-pass/"" target=""_blank""><em>Escape Academy</em></a> had split-screen co-op, I was in. And even as someone who’s not exactly “into” real-world escape rooms, it ended up being a fun, not-too-frustrating time with memorable scenarios like a room with rising water, or a scramble to find an antidote after being poisoned. I’d recommend <em>Escape Academy</em> — particularly after <a href=""https://twitter.com/CoinCrewGames/status/1559917246893506564"" target=""_blank"">today’s update</a>, which includes FOV options and a much-needed change to avoid accidental hints.</p>
<p>If you’re just here for the field-of-view slider, you can now crank the FOV from 60 all the way up to 120. That also goes for the console versions of <em>Escape Academy</em> — I tested it out on my PlayStation 5 copy this morning. I’ll probably settle somewhere in the middle. You can access this slider from the Graphics menu, and you can change it while you’re in an escape room, so you can quickly figure out what FOV works best for you.</p>
<p>Coin Crew Games also included a split-screen toggle in online multiplayer, a “hint confirmation,” and info about your best grade for each level on the replay board (though it is not retroactive). Considering <em>Escape Academy</em> is getting 10 new levels spread across two DLC drops (with the first, “Escape from Anti-Escape Island,” coming this fall), this is great.</p>

<h2>No more accidental hints</h2>
<p>I’ll admit, I did accidentally request a hint when I didn’t mean to — it was just a button press away! — which was frustrating. Solving everything on your own will lead to a better grade. Now, post-patch, in order to get a hint you’ll have to press the button twice.</p>
<p>Apart from bug fixes (<a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1812090/view/3391793024775744109"" target=""_blank"">which you can see on this Steam page</a>), <em>Escape Academy</em> also has some gameplay- and scoring-related changes to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased maximum mouse sensitivity (25%).</li>
<li>Online partner’s mouse cursor is now hidden.</li>
<li>Changed the grading system to be a bit more harsh — we’re not grading on a curve anymore!</li>
<li>Changed key difficulties ratings for some rooms, to better match their actual difficulty.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s flying under the radar, and a few of the later levels left me wanting, but <em>Escape Academy</em> is absolutely worth playing if you have a puzzle-solving partner.</p>

<p>The window given right now is <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f5fPTFdv1M&amp;list=PLBnrd5k2F2INdjLweJqlvK0OCRIJPg_O2&amp;index=17"">“early 2023,”</a> and PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Stadia, and Luna were specifically mentioned in the reveal (as were “cloud platforms”). Cross-play and cross-progression are confirmed ahead of time too, which is a nice surprise that doesn’t require us to dig into a hidden FAQ to figure out if that’s actually planned or not.</p>
<p>In case you forgot, <em>Trackmania</em> is the shortened title for the 2020 rendition of the series, which launched as a free-to-play game. As of today, a yearly “club level” subscription costs $29.99, which has still earned the ire of many prospective players. As Ubisoft puts it, you can: “Enhance your experience with Standard Access and unleash your creativity. Play solo or multiplayer on seasonal campaigns and keep track of your progression with medal collection, trophies, and regional and worldwide rankings.”</p>
<p>The combination of only being available on PC and the subscription model has squarely put <em>Trackmania</em> 2020 in the “maybe” column since launch. At this point, quickly being able to boot it up on a console could sway me to give it another shot.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>

The Cloud, too
A Trackmania console release is slated for “early 2023,” according to an announcement made in an Ubisoft Forward stream today.
The window given right now is “early 2023,” and PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Stadia, and Luna were specifically mentioned in the reveal (as were “cloud platforms”). Cross-play and cross-progression are confirmed ahead of time too, which is a nice surprise that doesn’t require us to dig into a hidden FAQ to figure out if that’s actually planned or not.
In case you forgot, Trackmania is the shortened title for the 2020 rendition of the series, which launched as a free-to-play game. As of today, a yearly “club level” subscription costs $29.99, which has still earned the ire of many prospective players. As Ubisoft puts it, you can: “Enhance your experience with Standard Access and unleash your creativity. Play solo or multiplayer on seasonal campaigns and keep track of your progression with medal collection, trophies, and regional and worldwide rankings.”
The combination of only being available on PC and the subscription model has squarely put Trackmania 2020 in the “maybe” column since launch. At this point, quickly being able to boot it up on a console could sway me to give it another shot.

		Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs
Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.
The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.

In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.

<p>Behaviour Interactive’s <em>Dead by Daylight</em> is surely one of the scariest multiplayer games on the market right now, but do you know what would make it even scarier? If you added CARDS. Think of the risk of papercuts. If you agree with me, (which you shouldn’t), then you’ll be happy to hear that the asymmetrical multiplayer will be headed to a tabletop near you later in 2022.</p>
<p>The developer <a href=""https://behaviour-interactive.prezly.com/level-99-and-behaviour-interactive-will-offer-fans-a-board-game-version-of-dead-by-daylight-this-halloween"" target=""_blank"">has teamed with game-maker Level 99</a> to produce a board game based on the survival horror title. Typically titled <em>Dead by Daylight,</em> the new game hopes to transpose the hide ‘n’ hunt nature of the video game to your dining room, complete with teams of survivors, a variety of deadly killers, various missions and tasks, generators. and even a cute plastic equivalent of <em>DbD</em>‘s “hook-hanging” sequence.</p>

<p>“As fans of the original video game, we worked hard to capture the tension between the Survivors and the Killer on every turn,” says Level 99 designer D. Brad Talton Jr. “The moment when you commit to your move and then have to hold your breath while the Killer makes their play — to me that’s the essence of <em>Dead by Daylight.</em>”</p>
<p>The new game, like so many licensed board games of the modern age, will be crowdfunded on Kickstarter, with funding opening on March 29. A Standard Edition, priced at $49.99, will include six Killers, seven Survivors, and two maps, while a prestige Collector’s Edition, priced at $99.99, 16 Killers, 17 Survivors, and four maps. Level 99 promises an entire cast of characters leading up to the release of <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dead-by-daylights-bts-collaborated-k-pop-killer-is-cutting-more-than-records/"" target=""_blank"">the <em>All-Kill</em> DLC</a> — so a lot of your favorite slashers will be in the mix.</p>

<h2>Fan Fest was a blast, I’m glad it’s back</h2>
<p>In-person <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> Fan Festivals were on hold, but Square Enix <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Plryox-p6SU"">has triumphantly announced</a> that they’re back on as of 2023.</p>
<p>By way of a new YouTube video, the publisher is ready to bring back the convention series to in-person events, starting with a kickoff in Las Vegas, Nevada (a prior Fan Fest site in the US) in July of 2023. Several months later the team will move to London in October of that same year, followed by a concluding Fan Fest in “early 2024” in Japan.</p>
<p>For those of you who aren’t aware of Fan Fest, it’s <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/square-enixs-second-final-fantasy-xiv-fanfest-was-full-of-passionate-players/"">a two-day celebration of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a>, complete with merch to buy, hands-on events and challenges (some of which are unique to the convention), meet and greets, and even full-on concerts and performances. Typically, we also get content teases and reveals, including new jobs and features of upcoming updates and whatever future expansion is in store at the time.</p>
<p>If you’re remotely a fan of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, I highly recommend attending. Given the cooperative nature of the game itself, and the positive reputation of the fanbase, it’s a great way to meet people or just enjoy the game on your own.</p>

Fan Fest was a blast, I’m glad it’s back
In-person Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festivals were on hold, but Square Enix has triumphantly announced that they’re back on as of 2023.
By way of a new YouTube video, the publisher is ready to bring back the convention series to in-person events, starting with a kickoff in Las Vegas, Nevada (a prior Fan Fest site in the US) in July of 2023. Several months later the team will move to London in October of that same year, followed by a concluding Fan Fest in “early 2024” in Japan.
For those of you who aren’t aware of Fan Fest, it’s a two-day celebration of Final Fantasy XIV, complete with merch to buy, hands-on events and challenges (some of which are unique to the convention), meet and greets, and even full-on concerts and performances. Typically, we also get content teases and reveals, including new jobs and features of upcoming updates and whatever future expansion is in store at the time.
If you’re remotely a fan of Final Fantasy XIV, I highly recommend attending. Given the cooperative nature of the game itself, and the positive reputation of the fanbase, it’s a great way to meet people or just enjoy the game on your own.
You can find the full landing page for Fan Fest here.
Final Fantasy XIV Fan Festival 2023-2024 dates:

Las Vegas, Nevada: July 28-29, 2023 (Las Vegas Convention Center)
London, UK: October 21-22, 2023 (ExCeL London)
Japan: Early 2024 (no venue selected yet)

<h2>Publisher’s handling of Equal Pay Act cases leads to protest</h2>
<p>Yesterday, over 150 employees walked out of Riot Games’ offices in Los Angeles to hold a “down tools”-style protest over the <em>League of Legends</em> publishers handling of recent discrimination lawsuits. The protest was also directed at the company’s alleged culture of sexism in the workplace, which came to the forefront following <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://kotaku.com/inside-the-culture-of-sexism-at-riot-games-1828165483"">an investigation by Kotaku’s Cecilia D’Anastasio back in August 2018</a>.</p>
<p>Following the Kotaku report, a number of employees filed suit against Riot Games. The publisher then filed a motion to place two of these cases into Forced Arbitration, essentially preventing them from ever appearing before a jury, or allowing the plaintiffs to appeal on the given result. Essentially, by being an employee of the company, you waive your right to take any case with your employer to court.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/riot%2520walkout%2520protest%25201-noscale.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<p>And so, yesterday afternoon, around 150 Riot team members (nicknamed by the studio as “Rioters”) held a walkout protest, gathering in the studio’s parking lot. Some employees carried signs and placards, bearing statements such as “Be the company you say you are” and “I reported, he got promoted.” Others delivered passionate speeches and gave interviews to the press on their own grievances, with some dismayed at the lack of change since the Kotaku report. “So far I haven’t seen a single outcome of our diversity and inclusion efforts at Riot,” one employee told Kotaku <a href=""https://kotaku.com/riot-employees-prepare-for-walkout-today-1834553458"" target=""_blank"">ahead of the walkout</a>. “I haven’t seen a single metric or number to indicate things have improved and I haven’t seen a single project get finished.”</p>
<p>Riot Games delivered a statement of their own regarding the protest. “We support Rioters making their voices heard today,” said the publisher <a href=""https://variety.com/2019/gaming/news/riot-games-walkout-1203206306/"" target=""_blank"">in comments to Variety</a>. “We have asked all managers to make every accommodation to allow Rioters to participate during the 2-4 P.M. window, including freeing up meeting times. We respect Rioters who choose to walkout today and will not tolerate retaliation of any kind as a result of participating (or not).”</p>
<p>However, in terms of actual change, Riot Games currently plans only to offer the opportunity to opt-out of Forced Arbitration to its future employees. <a href=""https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/commitments-on-arbitration-and-cultural-transformation"" target=""_blank"">Riot says it will consider extending that option to its current workforce</a>, once all ongoing litigation cases have been resolved. But it’s fair to reiterate that Riot stated it will <a href=""https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/commitments-on-arbitration-and-cultural-transformation"" target=""_blank"">“commit to have a firm answer”</a> regarding current employee rights, so that’s a consideration, not a promise.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/riot%2520walkout%2520protest%25202-noscale.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<p>At the end of yesterday’s action, it was noted by Riot Social Listening Strategist Jocelyn Monahan that further action would be taken if the protesting staff felt that no commitment toward progress had been made by the date of the studio’s next internal meeting, scheduled for May 16. In the meantime, Riot’s Dublin office held their own walkout just this afternoon.</p>
<p>The video game industry – and in particular the working conditions of its talented developers – has recently been under the spotlight unlike any other time in recent memory. Hopefully, events such as yesterday’s protest will encourage commitment towards positive changes in game studios everywhere. More so, that the courage on display gives similarly disgruntled team members the confidence to speak out against any form of injustice they feel negatively impacts not only their work but, more importantly, their pride, lives and mental well-being.</p>

<h2>The Scales of War</h2>
<p>We’re looking to the skies once again, retro gaming fans, as Hamster has released another sky-blasting shmup to its ever-expanding Arcade Archives range. It’s Namco sequel<em> Dragon Saber</em>, now available to download on <a href=""https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0571-CUSA33951_00-HAMPRDC000000001"" target=""_blank"">PS4</a> and <a href=""https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/arcade-archives-dragon-saber-switch/"" target=""_blank"">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
<p>Released into arcades in 1990,<em> Dragon Saber</em> is the follow-up to 1987’s <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/namco-shmup-dragon-spirit-joins-the-arcade-archives/"" target=""_blank"">fantasy-themed blaster<em> Dragon Spirit</em></a>, and once again sees dragon-riding heroes take to the skies to battle armies of strange, invading creatures. As Huey and Siria, one or two players can jump into all-new simultaneous co-op action, which should give you a bit of balance against the hundreds of enemies and end-of-level guardians. In addition, <em>Dragon Saber</em> features a selection of new power-ups, along with a continuation of the game’s lore, which was something of a novelty in the shmup genre at the time.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, <em>Dragon Saber</em> did not receive a wide range of ports, only coming home in the form of a lone PC Engine edition. Aside from appearances on Namco’s previous compilations, this Arcade Archives release represents the first global release of the sequel in some years.<em> Dragon Saber</em> is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

We’re looking to the skies once again, retro gaming fans, as Hamster has released another sky-blasting shmup to its ever-expanding Arcade Archives range. It’s Namco sequel Dragon Saber, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.

<h2>‘PlayStation 5 Showcase 2021’ is airing on September 9 at 1PM PT</h2>
<p>This generation is especially weird due to current world events. If everything was normal we’d have a few more “next/current gen” games by now. But at the moment, we’re working with a delayed <em>Halo Infinite</em> and a handful of PS5 exclusives like <em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-ratchet-clank-rift-apart/"">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a>, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-demons-souls-ps5/"">Demon’s Souls</a></em>, and <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-returnal/""><em>Returnal</em></a>.

<h2>Possible crossover with XCOM, inspiration sources, and more</h2>
<p>Last weekend during its panel at PAX East, Firaxis announced the next big project for the <em>Civilization</em> franchise: <em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/civilization-explores-the-final-frontier-with-beyond-earth-273190.phtml"">Civilization: Beyond Earth</a></em>. After the announcement, Destructoid took some time to talk to some of the designers behind bringing the strategy series into space.</p>
<p>Lead Designers David McDonough and Will Miller were present for the interview along with Systems Gameplay Designer Anton Strenger. The designers discussed the inspiration behind <em>Beyond Earth</em>, some of the world building systems, and the possibility for crossover with other Firaxis science fiction properties. Read it below!</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/CivBE1-620x.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<p><strong>Destructoid</strong>: Anything you want to say about <em>Civilization: Beyond Earth</em> right off the bat?<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Miller</strong>: We’ve been working on this game for a while, and to announce it today in front of some of our biggest fans is just the coolest thing. It’s a really fun game. You know, it’s <em>Civilization</em> in space! Our fans have been wanting this for a long time, and this is it.</p>
<p><strong>Destructoid</strong>: What sort of challenges are there converting <em>Civilization</em> to sci-fi?<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>McDonough</strong>: There are lots. It’s really exciting. <em>Civ</em> is a game with a great legacy, but it’s almost all historically based. Among that legacy are <em>Alpha Centauri</em> and <em>XCOM</em>. This game is inspired by all of those.  The things that make <em>Civ</em> fun, when you play <em>Civ</em> you always want to go “one more turn,” but the world around it is already set. Without history we have to make up technology trees, alien worlds, and that has been one of the bigger challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Destructoid</strong>: We were curious about how you would handle technology in <em>Beyond Earth</em>. How much is based off of what scientists are saying may be possible and how much is more like “hey this would be really cool if we did this”?</p>
<p><strong>McDonough</strong>: It’s both! We did a lot of research on modern day scientific thinking and we thought it was important that our game start in reality, in a plausible setting. For the rest, we were inspired by a lot of current science fiction. But the best sci-fi is also scientifically real, so hopefully we have the best of both.</p>
<p><iframe width=""620"" height=""349"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/qtYWqE55s24"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Destructoid</strong>: Take me through the timeline. Where does this start? Is it present day onward?</p>
<p><strong>Miller</strong>: It’s 200 to 250 years after present day. So we’re imagining an earth in the future, and things good and bad have happened, and it culminates in an event where nations around the world are sending out expeditions into space to different planets to colonize, to spread the roots of humanity beyond our planet. So, like David said, we start in a very familiar place based on actual science, and we want to be able to draw a clear line from science that we know today and space travel we know today. We’re very inspired by things like SpaceX and the new <em>Cosmos</em> with Neil deGrasse Tyson, we just love all that stuff. So we’re taking all of the inspiration from that and keeping it very plausible, and starting from a new place 200 years from now and kind of just going wild.</p>
<p><strong>Destructoid</strong>: You said you’ve been working on this for a long time. Exactly how long have you been working on this?</p>
<p><strong>McDonough</strong>: Unfortunately we can’t say specifically, but I think Will and I have been designing it in our heads for a really long time. Whispering in some ears around Firaxis.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Miller</strong>: That’s kind of how games get made around Firaxis. <em>XCOM</em> was Jake Solomon’s baby for a long time, and he whispered in the right ears, and it eventually became a great game. We were given our shot at this, and it was the right time. We had a team that really wanted to do it, and it fit in our schedule, and we’re so fortunate to be able to make this game.</p>
<p><strong>Destructoid</strong>: Did it start out as “Hey, wouldn’t it be rad if we made <em>Alpha Centauri</em>?” and went from there to “Well, we can’t really, but let’s do basically that”?</p>
<p><strong>Miller</strong>: It’s always been a reality to us that that IP is just sort of off limits, and I don’t know if we would have used it if we had it, honestly. This game is such a different thing. It’s definitely inspired by <em>Alpha Centauri</em>, but it’s also inspired by a lot of other things too. It’s a very different game and it has very different characteristics. It feels a lot different. I think it started as “Would it be cool if we could take <em>Civilization</em> into space? What would that game look like?” and then we went from there.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/CivBE2-620x.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<p><strong>Destructoid</strong>: Is there any chance for any sort of crossover with <em>XCOM</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Miller</strong>: The two games exist in their own fictional universes. That gives us the most flexibility, but I think you could expect some nods and winks and homages between the two.</p>
<p><strong>McDonough</strong>: One of the things about sci-fi is you can make easter eggs with no problem.</p>
<p><strong>Destructoid</strong>: So you’re going off and exploring alien worlds. What’s the variety going to be like for that?</p>
<p><strong>Strenger</strong>: We spent a lot of time making the map so that it isn’t just like, earth and then purple earth. So everything in the map generator like landmass features to other crazy things to the alien life that is populating that map can change. We have a lot of different biomes, like an arid biome or a wetter jungle one. So the combinations really make it so every time you play, it’s a unique world with its own challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Destructoid</strong>: You guys seem pretty excited for this.</p>
<p><strong>McDonough</strong>: The panel today was unbelievably cool, to see the reactions from the fans. We’ve been waiting a long time to be able to show it. We’ve been waiting a long time to come back to <em>Civilization</em> in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Miller</strong>: This game really is for our fans. For so long, our fans have been asking for a remake of <em>Alpha Centauri</em> or <em>Civ</em> in space or whatever, and this really is our game for them.</p>

Possible crossover with XCOM, inspiration sources, and more
Last weekend during its panel at PAX East, Firaxis announced the next big project for the Civilization franchise: Civilization: Beyond Earth. After the announcement, Destructoid took some time to talk to some of the designers behind bringing the strategy series into space.
Lead Designers David McDonough and Will Miller were present for the interview along with Systems Gameplay Designer Anton Strenger.

<h2>A future so bright it’s literally blinding</h2>
<p>If there is one thing I’ve learned from the current era of pop culture, it’s that I shouldn’t get too attached to the characters and stories that entertain me and bring me joy. Because, inevitably, this world will find a way to ruin everything that we love. Whether it’s turning <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)"" target=""_blank"">cinema’s most magical moviegoing experience</a> into one of the <a href=""https://www.flixist.com/review-jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom/"" target=""_blank"">stupidest film franchises ever</a>, or stripping away all meaning from a beloved character so you can endlessly monetize them, there are no depths companies and corporations won’t sink to if it means squeezing out a few more nickels from their fans and consumers.</p>
<p>That’s why I honestly have no problem with something like <em>MultiVersus</em>, the upcoming platform fighter from Player First Games and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Pop culture has beaten me into submission when it comes to complaining about this kind of misuse of adored IPs. It’s honestly a losing battle to try and fight it, so I choose to just go with the flow. If Warner Bros. is cool having a <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-director-says-the-iron-giant-fighting-because-alternate-universe/"" target=""_blank"">weapon of mass destruction that famously doesn’t want to fight</a> beating the snot out of a child, then I say why not. What the hell, anything goes on this <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/ugly-sonic-movie-design-tim-robinson-haunt-chip-n-dale-rescue-rangers/"" target=""_blank"">everything bagel</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-jpZPe0zblM?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<h2>MultiVersus alpha impressions</h2>
<p>Like with all other free-to-play games on the market, the <em>MultiVersus</em> alpha starts everyone out with a brief but detailed tutorial explaining how everything works. If you’re coming into this straight from <em>Smash</em> or <em>Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl</em>, a lot of what you’ll experience here will be familiar. You’re still trying to do enough damage to an opponent until you’re able to knock them out of the stage.</p>
<p>But don’t think you can get by ignoring the tutorial information. While this is a platform fighter with similar attack inputs (directional basic attacks and directional special attacks) it’s a pretty different beast of a game with its own systems and unique stylings. For starters, the game is very upfront about attack fatigue. Spamming the same move weakens it, forcing players to use their entire arsenal if they want to continue doing serious damage. The game also doesn’t have a block button. You can dodge, and it is a <em>vital</em> tool in any match you’ll play, but that’s tied to a dodge meter that’ll dwindle if you use it too much. Most characters have one or more moves that have a cooldown timer tied to them as well. In the air, all characters have two jumps, two air dodges, and two special attacks they can use without touching the ground. All characters also have the ability to wall jump, which makes getting back onto the stage pretty damn easy. With all of those changes and more to the familiar formula, most players will probably have to approach <em>MultiVersus</em> differently from other fighters in the genre.</p>
<p>Unless you’re already an expert airborne fighter. If that’s the case, you’ll fit right in here.</p>
<p>I am not somebody who enjoys fighting in the air with platform fighters. I’m very much a keep-my-feet-on-the-ground type of brawler. However, that’s really not an option with a lot of the available characters here. A few, like Superman and Taz, have powerful enough attacks that you can knock out an opponent from the ground. But most of the fighters here feel pretty damn weak, and if you want to effectively eliminate your foes, you’re going to want to follow them into the air after you’ve knocked them sky high to finish the job. For me, that has taken some getting used to, as has the floaty nature of jumping in this game, but I’m excited to use the skills I’ve been developing here in the other platform fighters I play.</p>
<p>While you can play in 1v1 and free-for-all modes, as well as against bots, the core <em>MultiVersus</em> experience is its 2v2 team battles. As you go through the training, you’ll get a sneak peek of how certain characters in the game are designed around team gameplay. And, like support characters in <em>Overwatch</em>, getting good with one of these fighters will make you indispensable when playing with friends and strangers online. For this closed alpha, the online connection has been rock-solid, above and beyond anything Nintendo has ever achieved with its flagship fighter.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/180eea02e3280-B5Reqffj7dTqCOzQBCupuEMP-scaled.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""MultiVersus beta impressions"" /></p>
<h2>Choose your fighter carefully</h2>
<p>In regards to the playable characters for the <em>MultiVersus</em> alpha, there are 15 at your disposal. Outside of Iron Giant, everyone who’s been announced so far is in. That means Shaggy and Velma from <em>Scooby-Doo</em>, Finn and Jake from <em>Adventure Time,</em> Steven and Garnet from <em>Steven Universe</em>, a handful of superheroes, cartoon characters, and a girl who has no name. There’s also future-must-have-plush-toy Reindog, a four-legged beast who is a godsend in team battles if the player using them knows how to effectively utilize their entire skillset. Not every fighter is available right away. For whatever reason, several, including Arya Stark, Batman, and Garnet, are locked away until you can earn enough coins to purchase them. I understand that being the case when the game actually launches, but why are you making me work during a closed alpha?</p>
<p>If you want to test any of these characters out, you can do that in the training mode. Not only will this let you try before you buy, but it’ll also help you adapt to the wildly varied playstyles of each fighter.</p>
<p>I have to give Player First Games credit. I think the core cast of <em>MultiVersus</em> is the most eclectic group of fighters in the genre, both in terms of where they’re pulled from and how their unique attributes create a playstyle that is distinct from every other fighter. For a cast of characters controlled with the same general inputs, there is very little similarity between them. They’re also creative in a way that really taps into who they are as a character and how their identity is reflected in their play style. Take Velma, for instance. This “experimental” support character — all characters here have classes like support, mage, tank, bruiser, etc. — is designed around the concept of solving mysteries. As she fights, clues will drop out of her opponents. If she picks up enough of these clues, she can “solve the mystery,” which in this case, means sending in a cop car to nab a competitor. If you play this move right, you can trap your opponent over a pit for an easy elimination.</p>
<p>That is the type of creativity that permeates many of the characters here. Some are pretty basic. I don’t think too many people are going to be wowed by the likes of Superman or Batman, even though they’re both efficient fighters. But when you look at Tom &amp; Jerry, who are brilliantly animated in a way that all of Tom’s attacks are just him taking swipes at Jerry, it’s hard not to be awestruck by what the developers managed to do here. By the way, if you’re decent with Rosalina in <em>Smash</em>, you’ll want to gravitate toward Tom &amp; Jerry right away.</p>

A future so bright it’s literally blinding
If there is one thing I’ve learned from the current era of pop culture, it’s that I shouldn’t get too attached to the characters and stories that entertain me and bring me joy. Because, inevitably, this world will find a way to ruin everything that we love. Whether it’s turning cinema’s most magical moviegoing experience into one of the stupidest film franchises ever, or stripping away all meaning from a beloved character so you can endlessly monetize them, there are no depths companies and corporations won’t sink to if it means squeezing out a few more nickels from their fans and consumers.
That’s why I honestly have no problem with something like MultiVersus, the upcoming platform fighter from Player First Games and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Pop culture has beaten me into submission when it comes to complaining about this kind of misuse of adored IPs. It’s honestly a losing battle to try and fight it, so I choose to just go with the flow. If Warner Bros. is cool having a weapon of mass destruction that famously doesn’t want to fight beating the snot out of a child, then I say why not. What the hell, anything goes on this everything bagel.

MultiVersus alpha impressions
Like with all other free-to-play games on the market, the MultiVersus alpha starts everyone out with a brief but detailed tutorial explaining how everything works. If you’re coming into this straight from Smash or Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, a lot of what you’ll experience here will be familiar. You’re still trying to do enough damage to an opponent until you’re able to knock them out of the stage.
But don’t think you can get by ignoring the tutorial information. While this is a platform fighter with similar attack inputs (directional basic attacks and directional special attacks) it’s a pretty different beast of a game with its own systems and unique stylings. For starters, the game is very upfront about attack fatigue. Spamming the same move weakens it, forcing players to use their entire arsenal if they want to continue doing serious damage. The game also doesn’t have a block button. You can dodge, and it is a vital tool in any match you’ll play, but that’s tied to a dodge meter that’ll dwindle if you use it too much. Most characters have one or more moves that have a cooldown timer tied to them as well. In the air, all characters have two jumps, two air dodges, and two special attacks they can use without touching the ground. All characters also have the ability to wall jump, which makes getting back onto the stage pretty damn easy. With all of those changes and more to the familiar formula, most players will probably have to approach MultiVersus differently from other fighters in the genre.
Unless you’re already an expert airborne fighter. If that’s the case, you’ll fit right in here.
I am not somebody who enjoys fighting in the air with platform fighters. I’m very much a keep-my-feet-on-the-ground type of brawler. However, that’s really not an option with a lot of the available characters here. A few, like Superman and Taz, have powerful enough attacks that you can knock out an opponent from the ground. But most of the fighters here feel pretty damn weak, and if you want to effectively eliminate your foes, you’re going to want to follow them into the air after you’ve knocked them sky high to finish the job. For me, that has taken some getting used to, as has the floaty nature of jumping in this game, but I’m excited to use the skills I’ve been developing here in the other platform fighters I play.
While you can play in 1v1 and free-for-all modes, as well as against bots, the core MultiVersus experience is its 2v2 team battles. As you go through the training, you’ll get a sneak peek of how certain characters in the game are designed around team gameplay. And, like support characters in Overwatch, getting good with one of these fighters will make you indispensable when playing with friends and strangers online. For this closed alpha, the online connection has been rock-solid, above and beyond anything Nintendo has ever achieved with its flagship fighter.

Choose your fighter carefully
In regards to the playable characters for the MultiVersus alpha, there are 15 at your disposal. Outside of Iron Giant, everyone who’s been announced so far is in. That means Shaggy and Velma from Scooby-Doo, Finn and Jake from Adventure Time, Steven and Garnet from Steven Universe, a handful of superheroes, cartoon characters, and a girl who has no name. There’s also future-must-have-plush-toy Reindog, a four-legged beast who is a godsend in team battles if the player using them knows how to effectively utilize their entire skillset. Not every fighter is available right away. For whatever reason, several, including Arya Stark, Batman, and Garnet, are locked away until you can earn enough coins to purchase them. I understand that being the case when the game actually launches, but why are you making me work during a closed alpha?
If you want to test any of these characters out, you can do that in the training mode. Not only will this let you try before you buy, but it’ll also help you adapt to the wildly varied playstyles of each fighter.
I have to give Player First Games credit. I think the core cast of MultiVersus is the most eclectic group of fighters in the genre, both in terms of where they’re pulled from and how their unique attributes create a playstyle that is distinct from every other fighter. For a cast of characters controlled with the same general inputs, there is very little similarity between them. They’re also creative in a way that really taps into who they are as a character and how their identity is reflected in their play style. Take Velma, for instance. This “experimental” support character — all characters here have classes like support, mage, tank, bruiser, etc. — is designed around the concept of solving mysteries. As she fights, clues will drop out of her opponents. If she picks up enough of these clues, she can “solve the mystery,” which in this case, means sending in a cop car to nab a competitor. If you play this move right, you can trap your opponent over a pit for an easy elimination.
That is the type of creativity that permeates many of the characters here. Some are pretty basic. I don’t think too many people are going to be wowed by the likes of Superman or Batman, even though they’re both efficient fighters. But when you look at Tom &amp; Jerry, who are brilliantly animated in a way that all of Tom’s attacks are just him taking swipes at Jerry, it’s hard not to be awestruck by what the developers managed to do here. By the way, if you’re decent with Rosalina in Smash, you’ll want to gravitate toward Tom &amp; Jerry right away.

Looking toward the future
If this does manage to take off, the sky’s the limit for potential characters. Warner Bros. has an exceptionally strong catalog it can pillage, from Ocean’s 11 to the Wizarding World, from Rin Tin Tin to And Just Like That. While I doubt we’ll be seeing Carrie Bradshaw use her Manolo Blahniks to curb stomp Professor Snape anytime soon, I wouldn’t be surprised if the developers at Player First Games get creative with future combatants. Given what they did with the likes of Velma, I think there is plenty of imagination within the development team to keep things fun and interesting for years to come. Or, the game could just be used as a marketing tool for whatever Warner Bros. movies and shows are about to premiere. If that’s the case, bring on Black Adam and whoever the hell Matt Smith is playing in that Game of Thrones prequel.
In terms of overall content for the MultiVersus alpha, it’s pretty slim pickins beyond the roster. The music is forgettable and there are only a couple of stages to fight on here. Most of my bouts have taken place on the requisite training grid stage (think Street Fighter V’s training stage meets Wii Fit Studio) or the Wonder Woman-themed Trophy’s Edge. I also fought a handful of matches on the Adventure Time Tree Fort stage and in Batman’s Batcave, the latter of which popped up far more rarely than it should have.

<h2>Slip and slide all the way around the song</h2>
<p>You’ve probably noticed <em>Trombone Champ </em>popping up all over your social media feeds over the last couple days or so. It is instantly recognizable as exactly what it is: a rhythm game about playing the trombone. The simplicity belies the point, though. <em>Trombone Champ </em>is a trombone rhythm game, and an exceedingly good one too.</p>
<p>At this point, I’d go into some sort of recitation of how <em><a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/1059990/Trombone_Champ/"" target=""_blank"">Trombone Champ</a> </em>sets this all up. Maybe how it handles, or what buttons it uses to do the things it does. The mouse moves a cursor up and down in inverted fashion, and your mouse click or any keyboard button is held to play notes.</p>
<p>Yet much like <em>Untitled Goose Game </em>or <em>Snipperclips</em>, this is the sort of experience you can just “get” by looking at it. It’s probably why the game has been circulating so fast through videos. I first saw this game on Giant Bomb’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWTpMiBnUg"" target=""_blank"">Unprofessional Fridays</a> segment, and again when PC Gamer’s <a href=""https://twitter.com/pcgamer/status/1572372646012260353"" target=""_blank"">lovely rendition of Beethoven’s Fifth</a> hit Twitter.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Booting it up myself, I was also amazed at how quick it all felt natural. Part of this is the easy control scheme. <em>Trombone Champ </em>starts you off easy, literally taking you through a few scales.</p>
<p>Now, full disclosure, I have partaken in some education in the ways of the trombone. I wouldn’t say I’m any kind of virtuoso, but it’s an instrument I’ve always enjoyed for a myriad of reasons. Reasons that, oddly enough, feel very well-reflected here.</p>
<h2>Reaching for seventh</h2>
<p>The trombone gets its goofy, glissando nature from the fact that it’s basically one big horn, and you’re holding a loose tuning slide. Where other instruments use plungers and the like, playing trombone means learning all the positions the slide has to be in for each note.</p>
<p>Early on, you might learn some rough approximations. First, second, third, fourth, etc. But as my old teachers would remind me, every note is different. You’re essentially tuning a horn on the fly to make notes happen. This is extremely interesting and rewarding to learn, and also just inherently goofy.</p>
<p>Playing <em>Trombone Champ</em>, you can hear players get in the ballpark of the right note and slide into it. Things will sound right-ish, but maybe not always exactly correct. And hearing an obvious miss, or a series of notes where the player’s slide is just trying to keep up with the cascade of notes, is really fun.</p>

<p>There’s an attention to detail here, in terms of the way <em>Trombone Champ </em>handles. Hitting a button on the keyboard starts and stops a note, and you can indeed run out of breath. One hand has to manage the articulation of the note, while the other manages the tuning via the slide.</p>
<p>The slide controls are inverted, which might seem strange at first. But on a trombone, higher notes tend to be played with the slide pulled <em>in</em>, while lower notes can need more tube and are thus pushed further <em>out</em>. (Anyone who’s had to reach for a low-E way out in seventh knows what I mean. My thanks to the inventor of trombone triggers.)</p>
<h2>Music in motion</h2>
<p>This trombone lecture is not just to validate years of band directors telling me this knowledge would be applicable in the real world. It’s to stress how effective <em>Trombone Champ </em>works as a rhythm game, because of its use of the real, physical, tactile nature of playing its star instrument.</p>
<p>It reminds me a bit of games like <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/this-qwop-cosplay-is-brilliant-in-its-simplicity/"" target=""_blank""><em>QWOP</em></a>, which captures a similar feeling of hilarity. Something that is beautiful when done well, and hilarious when done poorly. The friction hasn’t been taken out, just smoothed into part of the experience. It’s wonderful to me that many people are buying <em>Trombone Champ </em>with the expectation that they will be terrible at it.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/TromboneChamp_PlumFairy_092122.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" alt /></p>
<p>The public domain-infused soundtrack helps so much here, too. Everyone knows what tunes like <em>Gray Mare </em>or <em>Oh, Canada </em>should sound like. They can hear every note in their head. And when the expectation is met with a sliding, modulating trombone messily tooting it though? Beautiful.</p>
<p>Normally I’d lament the lack of big-name licensed tracks, but developer Holy Wow has picked out an excellent selection of familiar, recognizable songs. Anthems, culturally significant tunes, and motifs you probably heard in <em>Looney Tunes </em>growing up all make this a perfect setlist. Add in some made-for originals that are also quite good, and it’s a quite good launch lineup. Obviously, I’d love some custom track integration or a sort-of level editor, which the <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1059990/view/3385040795530927511"" target=""_blank"">studio says is on its mind</a>.

<h2>Plus, here are some of the companions</h2>
<p>The much-awaited spiritual successor to the <em>Suikoden </em>series <em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</em>, was recently confirmed to be <a href=""https://twinfinite.net/2021/05/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-delay/"" target=""_blank"">getting a delay in a recent backer update</a>. But while it will take a bit longer to deliver, there’s more <em>Eiyuden </em>on the way to help tide you over.</p>
<p>Announced during today’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda E3 media showcase, <em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes </em>is coming in 2023. Developer Rabbit &amp; Bear Studios showcased some of the new characters coming to the game, and also confirmed the RPG will launch in 2023.</p>

<p>While that’s a ways off, Rabbit &amp; Bear Studios also announced an action-RPG prequel of sorts—<em>Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising</em>. We get a glimpse of gameplay in the above trailer, and according to the <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/1658290/Eiyuden_Chronicle_Rising/"" target=""_blank"">Steam page</a>, it will have some town-building elements in addition to its action-RPG gameplay. <em>Rising </em>will tell the pre-war stories of various characters who will eventually become the player’s companions in <em>Eiyuden Chronicle</em>, and its launching in 2022. Both <em>Rising </em>and <em>Hundred Heroes </em>will be coming to Xbox Game Pass as well.</p>
<p>So while the Kickstarter hopefuls will be waiting a little longer, it looks like the <em>Eiyuden Chronicle </em>is expanding to even grander ambitions. We’ll see how the legend starts to shape up sometime next year.</p>

<p>Those naughty MultiVersus dataminers are at it again, delving into the code of Player First Games’ madcap platform fighter and pulling out clues pertaining to upcoming characters and stages — In fact, just this weekend, one such digger <a href=""https://twitter.com/multiversusie/status/1584180607177101317?s=20&amp;t=CI339P3hx-XJ070QVSuVqg"" target=""_blank"">ventured into the new update</a> and surfaced with a reference to the iconic 1985 classic, <em>The Goonies.</em></p>
<p>Directed by Richard Donner and written by Steven Spielberg, <em>The Goonies</em> tells the tale of a group of misfit children, who embark upon a wild adventure of danger and intrigue while exploring the legend of notorious pirate One-Eyed Willie. <em>The Goonies</em> has transcended generations due to its dopey slapstick comedy, <em>Indiana Jones</em>-esque action, and litany of quotable lines and memorable characters. Today, decades after its release, it remains something of a rite of passage for young film fans.</p>

Plus, here are some of the companions
The much-awaited spiritual successor to the Suikoden series Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes, was recently confirmed to be getting a delay in a recent backer update. But while it will take a bit longer to deliver, there’s more Eiyuden on the way to help tide you over.
Announced during today’s Xbox &amp; Bethesda E3 media showcase, Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes is coming in 2023. Developer Rabbit &amp; Bear Studios showcased some of the new characters coming to the game, and also confirmed the RPG will launch in 2023.

While that’s a ways off, Rabbit &amp; Bear Studios also announced an action-RPG prequel of sorts—Eiyuden Chronicle: Rising. We get a glimpse of gameplay in the above trailer, and according to the Steam page, it will have some town-building elements in addition to its action-RPG gameplay. Rising will tell the pre-war stories of various characters who will eventually become the player’s companions in Eiyuden Chronicle, and its launching in 2022. Both Rising and Hundred Heroes will be coming to Xbox Game Pass as well.
So while the Kickstarter hopefuls will be waiting a little longer, it looks like the Eiyuden Chronicle is expanding to even grander ambitions. We’ll see how the legend starts to shape up sometime next year.


 


						
	
		Truffle Shuffle Super
Those naughty MultiVersus dataminers are at it again, delving into the code of Player First Games’ madcap platform fighter and pulling out clues pertaining to upcoming characters and stages — In fact, just this weekend, one such digger ventured into the new update and surfaced with a reference to the iconic 1985 classic, The Goonies.
Directed by Richard Donner and written by Steven Spielberg, The Goonies tells the tale of a group of misfit children, who embark upon a wild adventure of danger and intrigue while exploring the legend of notorious pirate One-Eyed Willie. The Goonies has transcended generations due to its dopey slapstick comedy, Indiana Jones-esque action, and litany of quotable lines and memorable characters. Today, decades after its release, it remains something of a rite of passage for young film fans.

<h2>Turn out the lights</h2>
<p>A remake of <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>has been going around the rumor mill for <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/rumor-resident-evil-4-remake-currently-in-development-at-m-two/"" target=""_blank"">a little while now</a>. And according to a new report, it’ll be taking a little bit of a different tone.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.fanbyte.com/news/some-details-from-the-unannounced-resident-evil-4-remake/"" target=""_blank"">Fanbyte</a> has some new details on the reported remake, and how it will make some changes to the GameCube-era classic <em>Resident Evil 4</em>. According to their sources, Capcom wants to adjust the tone of the game, making it spookier. It’s not a “scene-for-scene” recreation, but taking some inspiration from the concepts in old <em>RE4 </em>demos and preview reels left on the cutting room floor.</p>
<p>Other side characters are reportedly set to have some more screen time and larger roles, and other aspects like <em>Assignment: Ada</em> and <em>Separate Ways </em>will get fleshed out. Earlier leaks about a Wesker redesign are, according to Fanbyte’s sources, not accurate; those are from a different, apparently canceled, <em>Resident Evil </em>project at Capcom.</p>
<p>The report does indicate that Capcom is hoping to announce the remake early this year, though that timeframe could shift.</p>

<p>The story changes line up with a recent statement from <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>director Shinji Mikami, where he said that if a remake did happen, it would be great if Capcom could “make the story better.” One aspect Fanbyte’s report highlights is potentially setting the village, and other sections, at night. That would certainly ramp up the horror aspect. The report indicates that Capcom approached Mikami and he was intrigued by the offer, but declined so he could stay at Tango Gameworks.</p>
<p>With the <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/resident-evil-3-remake-hits-five-million-sales-milestone/"" target=""_blank"">success</a> of the previous <em>Resident Evil </em>remakes, it certainly seems like <em>RE4 </em>would happen.

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

McCree’s namesake was one of several employees who departed the company in the wake of California’s lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, which alleges discrimination and a toxic work culture at the company.

<p>During the <em>Overwatch 2</em> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTUX1zacoZ4"" target=""_blank"">Reveal Event</a> this morning, Blizzard elaborated (somewhat!) on its free-to-play launch and what’s in the content pipeline for this live-service sequel.</p>
<p>If you’ve been waiting to hear more about PvE, welp, that wasn’t the focus of today’s stream — and the new story missions won’t be playable until 2023 — but we’ve got a roadmap for PvP and confirmation that <strong>loot boxes are out</strong> and a battle pass format is in.</p>
<p>Coming off of <em>Overwatch</em><em> 1</em>, the team’s main goal is to try and deliver content on a “frequent and consistent basis,” according to game director Aaron Keller.</p>
<p>Currently, they’re committing to major updates every nine weeks, starting with the launch on October 4. “Players can expect to see a new hero every other season, with elements like new maps and game modes in the seasons between,” <a href=""https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/overwatch/23814218/overwatch-2-reveal-event-recap"" target=""_blank"">Blizzard said in a blog post</a>.</p>
<h2>The 2022 roadmap and a tease for 2023</h2>

<p>As you can see from this roadmap, Season 1 of <em>Overwatch 2</em> will be out on October 4 with three new heroes — Sojourn, Junker Queen, and a new support hero, who Blizzard teased with a snippet of footage featuring a spirit fox. It’ll also be the debut of Push mode, six new maps, and more than 30 character skins, including a new Mythic tier of skins.</p>
<p>The first example of a Mythic skin was a cool Cyber Demon skin for Genji with customization elements like tattoos, masks, and colors. I’m… intrigued! And also worried about how much Mythic skins will cost (whether that’s actual money or time invested).</p>

<p>Other new cosmetics, like banners and weapon charms, will help pad out the battle pass; one example was a little frosted donut keychain. There will be a shop with virtual currency.</p>
<h2>Cross-progression</h2>
<p>Crucially, with all of this new Stuff for players to stockpile, Blizzard said that if you earn something on console, PC, or in <em>Overwatch 1</em>, you can use it in <em>Overwatch 2</em>. In other words, there’s cross-platform progression, which is definitely something they had to deliver. That said, the first <em>Overwatch 2</em> battle pass won’t be ready until Season 2 starts on December 6. After all this time, the launch — well, the “rollout,” really — sure seems gradual.</p>

<h2>Competitive</h2>
<p>Starting with Season 1 on October 4, <em>Overwatch 2</em> will have “a reimagined competitive experience that was created to give players more tools to improve gameplay and feel a sense of progression in competitive play,” according to Blizzard. “Players will have more of an impact on individual matches with the shift to 5v5, and there will be additional systems in place to help you discern your contributions per match.”</p>
<h2>Where’s PvE?</h2>
<p>As for <em>Overwatch 2</em> PvE, we got a few gameplay glimpses of Null Sector’s return and some fairly open-ended developer quotes about the team’s ambitions.</p>
<p>“With PvE, we have an opportunity to go a step further, to go deeper into diverse storytelling in ways that we really just haven’t been able to before,” said Keller. It’ll be delivered starting in 2023 “through the live service,” just like the PvP content. The team plans to show off (more of) where the characters are from in these PvE “experiences.”</p>
<h2>Beta sign-ups</h2>
<p>A new map, Rio, and Junker Queen, will be playable in the <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-2-console-pc-playstation-xbox-pvp-beta-starts-june-28/"" target=""_blank""><em>Overwatch 2</em> closed beta</a> starting on June 28. <a href=""https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/beta/"" target=""_blank"">Beta sign-ups are now available</a> for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>
<p>Notably, “Beta access does not roll over from the previous <em>Overwatch 2</em> PvP Beta.”</p>

Seasonal updates every nine weeks
During the Overwatch 2 Reveal Event this morning, Blizzard elaborated (somewhat!) on its free-to-play launch and what’s in the content pipeline for this live-service sequel.
If you’ve been waiting to hear more about PvE, welp, that wasn’t the focus of today’s stream — and the new story missions won’t be playable until 2023 — but we’ve got a roadmap for PvP and confirmation that loot boxes are out and a battle pass format is in.
Coming off of Overwatch 1, the team’s main goal is to try and deliver content on a “frequent and consistent basis,” according to game director Aaron Keller.
Currently, they’re committing to major updates every nine weeks, starting with the launch on October 4. “Players can expect to see a new hero every other season, with elements like new maps and game modes in the seasons between,” Blizzard said in a blog post.
The 2022 roadmap and a tease for 2023
Season 1 starts on October 4, followed by Season 2 on December 6.
As you can see from this roadmap, Season 1 of Overwatch 2 will be out on October 4 with three new heroes — Sojourn, Junker Queen, and a new support hero, who Blizzard teased with a snippet of footage featuring a spirit fox. It’ll also be the debut of Push mode, six new maps, and more than 30 character skins, including a new Mythic tier of skins.

A new map, Rio, and Junker Queen, will be playable in the Overwatch 2 closed beta starting on June 28. Beta sign-ups are now available for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.
Notably, “Beta access does not roll over from the previous Overwatch 2 PvP Beta.”

A video on Kirby and frame rates have come out since its debut
Just a few days ago, the Smash Ultimate screen-a-day fun ended, but another journey began: a Sakurai YouTube channel. He kicked things off by posting three videos: one that introduced the channel, one that introduced himself, and another that talked about the development concept of lingering.
In just two days he’s now amassed nearly 300,000 subscribers (283K at the time of publication), and has posted two more videos, which you can find below. He also has a Japanese YouTube channel, which has a comparable 246K subscribers at the time of publication. Since he provides English subtitles for his aforementioned English channel anyway while speaking in Japanese, the main difference for the latter is that the on-screen text is actually in Japanese — in addition to native language subtitles.

For five minutes, Sakurai talks about Kirby’s Dream Land in the new Sakurai YouTube channel clip. The 1992 Game Boy classic kicked off the series — and was also the first game Sakurai directed!

<h2>Looks like a lot changed thanks to early feedback</h2>
<p>Square Enix has locked in a date and official name for <em>Project Triangle Strategy</em>, which is now just <em>Triangle Strategy</em>. And while the launch date won’t be here for a little while, the studio is already outlining what changes it made to <em>Triangle Strategy</em> in response to surveys from those who played its demo.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/project-triangle-strategy-is-a-new-square-enix-hd-2d-srpg-with-a-switch-demo-today/"" target=""_blank"">Debut Demo</a> was released earlier this year, and according to Square Enix’s numbers, it was downloaded approximately one million times, as of Sept. 2021. Some of those players filled out the survey to provide feedback, and <a href=""https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/2021/triangle-strategy-debut-demo-survey-results-nintendo-switch/"" target=""_blank"">Square Enix shared some of the changes they’ve made</a> as a result.</p>

<p>A big one is loading times. Square Enix says loading times during events are now “approximately 10 seconds shorter in the most notable scenes,” and it aims to further shorten them by launch on March 4, 2022.</p>
<p>Players also won’t have to go back to the world map to see new events, and can instead go through them in quick succession. Auto-play and Skip features have been added, as have conversation logs, character profiles, and information review features. Those sound handy for keeping track of what’s what and who’s who.</p>
<p>Two additional difficulty settings, Hard and Easy, have been added as well. More camera options have been added, as have various quality-of-life upgrades for the battle interface. There’s even a “battle retry” feature now, and a lot of little changes that really look to add up for a smoother experience.</p>
<p>As someone who was already very intrigued by <em>Triangle Strategy </em>from the demo alone, I’m impressed. There are plenty of good changes being made, either to make <em>Triangle Strategy</em> a bit more approachable or to just make it a bit easier to understand. I’m a sucker for turn-based strategy RPGs, so this was already well up my alley, but <em>Triangle Strategy </em>is looking mighty strong right now.</p>

<div>
<h2><em>Stardew Valley</em>‘s grandpa has seen better days</h2>
<p>You’d think that so long <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stardew-valley-is-five-years-old-now-creator-thanks-fans-for-sticking-with-it/"" target=""_blank"">after its release</a> (now six years, to be exact), the <em>Stardew Valley</em> subreddit would have settled down by now, but in fact, it has done the opposite. While most of the posts usually consist of players posting bugs or how they’ve decorated their farms, a series of new memes have surfaced, which in turn has spawned a series of mods. The best part is that the joke isn’t even about anything in the actual core game itself, but instead in the introduction cutscene that plays when a player boots up a new save file. That’s right — it’s a bunch of<em> </em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/uazj0d/i_feel_like_ive_helped_kick_off_a_dying_grandpa/"">grandpa mods</a>.</p>
<p>The original scene starts with the player’s grandpa on his death bed (morbid, I know) as the game truly begins when the player inherits their grandfather’s farm and moves to Pelican Town. While the rest of the sequence shows the player character quitting their job and getting on the bus out to the country, it’s this first part that players have chosen to fixate on. You see, grandpa’s bed is looking a little rickety — kind of like the crappiest IKEA bed you can find, in fact, with just four skinny pieces of wood to hold it up. It looks like it’s ready to collapse at any second.</p>
<blockquote><p> <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/uazj0d/i_feel_like_ive_helped_kick_off_a_dying_grandpa/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share"">I feel like I’ve helped kick off a dying grandpa renaissance and honestly I’m so thrilled</a> from <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/"">StardewValley</a> </p></blockquote>
<p>Players thought this was pretty funny, and so they took the intro and ran with it by modding the opening scene of the game with their own interpretations.</p>
<p>One mod makes the already pretty crappy bed only <a href=""https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11737"" target=""_blank"">slightly worse</a>, while others depict the <a href=""https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11789"" target=""_blank"">already-dead grandpa</a> dead on the floor with flies buzzing around him. You can even mod him in the classic <a href=""https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11776"" target=""_blank""><em>Family Guy</em> death pose</a>, if you so wish. The most recent installment makes it look like he’s <a href=""https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11798"" target=""_blank"">wet the bed</a>. Someone even went to the trouble of adding a NSFW, uh, <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewMemes/comments/u96b4z/grandpa_noooooo/i5rh810/"" target=""_blank"">happy version</a> of grandpa’s death.</p>
<p>These mods are pretty silly, but I do have to admit that they play into the game’s tone in a fun way. <em>Stardew Valley</em>‘s opening with grandpa may make the game look all sweet and innocent from the start, but under the surface, it’s full of darker hidden content, like turning your unwanted children into doves, for example. I have to hand it to the <em>Stardew</em> Reddit community for their creativity, because these certainly made me chuckle.</p>

<p>Something<em> very</em> special from the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster takes time out from its recent Namco obsession to deliver not only a Tecmo title, but a fun, silly, and particularly obscure one at that — Available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch its forgotten fighter <em>Angel Eyes!</em></p>
<p>Released to Japanese arcades in 1996, <em>Angel Eyes</em> — or to give it its full title<em> Tōkidenshō Angel Eyes</em> — is a super cult 2D fighter that was renowned for sporting an All Anime Gal cast of scrappers. A selection of fun character tropes, including a school girl, a volleyball player, a kunoichi, an arrogant “ojou” woman, and a young girl with a giant teddy bear (<a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dnf-duel-enchantress-trailer-nexon-fighting-games-arcsys/"" target=""_blank"">predating Enchantress by several decades</a>), fight it out in cute ‘n’ colorful action, set against the backdrop of some equally strange locations, such as a fun fair, and a medieval castle!</p>
<p>Check out the cute ‘n’ crazy carnage in the video below, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR2L0bPxY_M"" target=""_blank"">courtesy of YouTuber Colmarr.</a></p>

<p><em>Angel Eyes</em>, despite its seeming irrelevance, had some surprisingly prescient ideas. Not only is it one of the first-ever “all women” fighting games, but it is also one of the first 2D fighters to feature a heavy slant on juggles and air combos. Perhaps its funniest and most bizarre mechanic, however, is reserved for the so-called “reverse combo correction” system, which actually<em> increases</em> damage the longer a combo goes on — rather than scales it back. And thus, players with one or two fairly solid combos can find themselves taking down their opponents in a manner of seconds.</p>
<p>You thought <em>Street Fighter V</em> was “three mistakes to death”? Try “one mistake to death”!</p>
<p>Despite its simplistic nature and dopey mechanics, Angel Eyes is, understandably, not without its charm. Though it would receive a JPN PlayStation point in 1997, the series would quietly disappear into the annals of fighting game history. Still, it’s lovely to see it again. And, as opposed to a lot of the Arcade Archives releases, <em>Angel Eyes</em> is a title that actually requires archiving, due to its obscure, rare nature.</p>
<p><em>Angel Eyes</em> is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.</p>

Stardew Valley‘s grandpa has seen better days
You’d think that so long after its release (now six years, to be exact), the Stardew Valley subreddit would have settled down by now, but in fact, it has done the opposite. While most of the posts usually consist of players posting bugs or how they’ve decorated their farms, a series of new memes have surfaced, which in turn has spawned a series of mods. The best part is that the joke isn’t even about anything in the actual core game itself, but instead in the introduction cutscene that plays when a player boots up a new save file. That’s right — it’s a bunch of grandpa mods.
The original scene starts with the player’s grandpa on his death bed (morbid, I know) as the game truly begins when the player inherits their grandfather’s farm and moves to Pelican Town. While the rest of the sequence shows the player character quitting their job and getting on the bus out to the country, it’s this first part that players have chosen to fixate on. You see, grandpa’s bed is looking a little rickety — kind of like the crappiest IKEA bed you can find, in fact, with just four skinny pieces of wood to hold it up. It looks like it’s ready to collapse at any second.
 I feel like I’ve helped kick off a dying grandpa renaissance and honestly I’m so thrilled from StardewValley 
Players thought this was pretty funny, and so they took the intro and ran with it by modding the opening scene of the game with their own interpretations.
One mod makes the already pretty crappy bed only slightly worse, while others depict the already-dead grandpa dead on the floor with flies buzzing around him. You can even mod him in the classic Family Guy death pose, if you so wish. The most recent installment makes it look like he’s wet the bed. Someone even went to the trouble of adding a NSFW, uh, happy version of grandpa’s death.
These mods are pretty silly, but I do have to admit that they play into the game’s tone in a fun way. Stardew Valley‘s opening with grandpa may make the game look all sweet and innocent from the start, but under the surface, it’s full of darker hidden content, like turning your unwanted children into doves, for example. I have to hand it to the Stardew Reddit community for their creativity, because these certainly made me chuckle.

<h2>Lemme tell you something</h2>
<p>I often opine that video games have <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-ghostbusters-2/"" target=""_blank"">not been very good</a> to <i>Ghostbusters. </i>I would think that the entrepreneurial attitude of the original movie depicting a very chaotic and game-like profession would be ripe for translation, but most titles that approach the subject matter fumble it. Sometimes they fumble it catastrophically. <i>Ghostbusters </i>on the NES is among the worst games I’ve ever played.</p>
<p>The go-to answer for a <i>Ghostbusters</i> game <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/review-ghostbusters-the-video-game-wii/"" target=""_blank"">done right</a> is <i>Ghostbusters: The Video Game</i>, and it’s absolutely a decent effort. However, despite getting together the original cast and sticking pretty faithfully to the license, the narrative felt tonally off, and the gameplay was merely middling.</p>
<p>If you want the game that really deserves to be considered the best title wearing the tan flightsuit, it’s <i>New Ghostbusters II </i>on the NES. You may have played <i>Ghostbusters II</i> back in the day and thought it was kind of butt, but I’m talking <i>New Ghostbusters II</i>. It was HAL Laboratories’ crack at the license, and they definitely nailed it.</p>

<h2>It’s a river of slime</h2>
<p>If you need a reminder, <i>Ghostbusters II </i>was the movie where they wore the sequel’s logo on their uniform. It wasn’t the masterpiece that the original film was, being a bit more dopey, commercial, and family-friendly (even though a couple of scenes traumatized me as a child). However, it still had a fun pace, good humor, and the same great cast. It’s definitely still worth watching, but being compared to the original <i>Ghostbusters</i> film is never going to end well for anybody.</p>
<p>While Activision had the rights to cash in on the film’s image in North America, HAL Laboratories got it for Japan, and the very next year in the United Kingdom. This meant that their version never landed on this side of the pond, but a similar game by them, <i>Ghostbusters II</i> on the Game Boy did while being published by Activision.</p>

<h2>Hot and ready to pop</h2>
<p>While Activision’s efforts are the kind of quality you’d typically expect from a licensed NES game, <i>New Ghostbusters II</i> is a joyful representation of the film. The whole experience is represented as a chibi-styled, top-down affair. You choose two of your favorite busters from a selection of five. Rick Moranis’ character, accountant Louis Tully, is also available. There’s no difference between any of them, so it’s all a matter of preference.</p>
<p>One of your chosen characters takes the lead with the proton pack, ensnaring ghosts and holding them into place. The other follows behind with the trap, throwing it out and capturing the entities. It’s all rather quick and snappy. It follows the concepts laid out in the film but manages to avoid making them a chore. It also boils down the gameplay to two buttons. Everything is done with the trap and proton pack. Nothing new is added throughout the game, but it gets a lot of mileage out of the basic mechanic.</p>
<p>The one downside this has is that your partner is AI controlled. They don’t exactly match your footsteps, instead wandering slightly. While this is definitely a more dynamic way to play the game, it does allow for rare instances where your trapper gets stuck somewhere. There was one boss encounter in particular where I snared my prey, only to notice that Egon wasn’t even on screen. I died as a result, and when I respawned, he was still AWOL. I had to search for him, discovering that he was stuck in the bathroom. Happens to the best of us.</p>

<h2>The Titanic just arrived</h2>
<p>The levels roughly follow the flow of the film. There are no cutscenes, so it’s up to you to remember how it all goes together. The whole game can be completed in under 45 minutes, but there are limited continues that threaten to push you back to the start. It’s not the hardest game, but it isn’t the easiest by a longshot. The third level in the apartments, for example, is a lot longer than the other stages and can be a test of endurance. <i>New Ghostbusters II</i> also has a habit of trying to surprise you, and since one hit can cost you a life, it’s easy to start shedding your extra busters.</p>
<p>While 45 minutes may sound rather brief – and it is – it means that the gameplay doesn’t have a chance to go stale. As much as the core concept is well-executed, not a lot is done with it. There are no power-ups, no alternate weapons like the slime blower, and no mechanics beyond enemy disposal that make use of it.</p>
<p>That’s unfortunate because a lot <i>could</i> be done with it. Not just through the implementation of proton-powered door locks, but through a wider foundation. Once again, I’m wishing for some sort of managerial meta for a Ghostbusters game. It’s too bad that <i>New Ghostbusters II</i> wasn’t some resounding success that begged the development of <i>New Ghostbusters II 2</i>. The core mechanics are great.

<p>What’s there is a tonne of fun, though.

<p>Yet, I still recommend <i>New Ghostbusters II </i>to any fan of the films. From the soundtrack to the core gameplay, there’s a lot of love in the final product.

<h2>This thing is so small and quiet you’d think it was a student at the Milford School</h2>
<p>One thing I’ve noticed with the past few console launches, something that became quite evident the day I preordered my Xbox Series S, is that I no longer feel the excitement I once did when moving into a new generation. Even last week, when I managed to secure an all-digital PS5 just minutes after I swore to stop trying until next year, it didn’t push me to jump for joy. I used to jump for joy picking up a new console. I remember being quite giddy standing in line at Walmart to buy the GameCube on a cold November morning.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because the promise of better technology has lead to diminishing returns over the past two console generations. Maybe it’s because there are no launch titles for the Xbox Series of consoles or the PS5 that I “must play now.” Or maybe, it’s because gaming is so prolific now that it’s really all about the games rather than the hardware you choose to play them on.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, I do miss the excitement that comes with anticipating a new console. But with my Xbox Series S, that feeling has been replaced by something that might be just as fulfilling: the satisfaction of knowing you bought quality hardware.  I love my Series S not because I managed to buy the “hot new thing” but because this console is built so goddamn good.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/SeriesSBoxsize-noscale.jpg?resize=640%2C258&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""Xbox Series S"" /></p>
<p>And it’s so much smaller than I thought it would be. This little white box measures 10.8″ long, 5.9″ deep, and 2.5″ tall when positioned on its side. It weighs less than five pounds. You could fit two of these in an Xbox Series X with a few square inches to spare. My current entertainment center is not well suited for multiple systems, so having a Wii U, PS4 Slim, and Switch hooked up to it takes up a decent amount of usable space. Thankfully, the Series S is so small it sits comfortably next to my Wii U. And unlike my PS4 Slim, this thing is quiet.</p>
<p>Setting this thing up took around five minutes going through the Xbox app on my phone. With everything synced up to my Xbox account, the console scanned my television and showed me which Series S options I can and cannot use. I know this is not a new technology, as some of my fellow writers were quick to explain to me in Slack, but it did teach me more about my television and how to access HDR content on my PS4. Getting 120 fps is out of the question as my TV doesn’t support it, but I can experience 4K on video playback and with any games that support it (and yes, some games support 4K on the Series S). </p>
<p>If you’re looking for a console with power, you should probably know what the Series S is packing in its petite body. Here are some of the specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU: 8x Cores at 3.6 GHz (Custom Zen 2 CPU)</li>
<li>GPU: 4 TFLOPS, 20 CUs @1.565 GHz</li>
<li>Memory: 10 GB GDDDR6</li>
<li>Internal Storage: 512 GB (364 GB usable)</li>
<li>Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby TrueHD with Atmos, DTS 5.1</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past month, I’ve come to love just how fast the Xbox Series S gets me into my games. Quick Restart is an outstanding feature. For games that support it, it’ll get you back into the action in mere seconds rather than having to wait for a game to load. And it does this across multiple titles at once rather than just having a single game in a suspend state. The console itself is quick to start too. If you go the environmentally friendly route with the Energy-Saver mode, it’ll take about 22 seconds to start up. If you choose Instant-On, it’s around four seconds.</p>
<p>I’m also really digging the redesigned controller. I’ve always preferred the layout of the Xbox controller over the PlayStation because I have good taste, but the changes here make it even better than before. Particularly, the directional pad has a nice “clicky” quality to it, and it’s a bit more comfortable to use than my Xbox One controller.</p>

<p>As of the publishing of this article, I haven’t actually bought any games for the console. Instead, I’ve been diving into Xbox Game Pass. And it’s a deep dive because there are <em>years</em> of games and franchises I’ve missed not being an Xbox owner. Games like <em>Fable III</em> and <i>Halo 4</i> that were once out of reach are now at my fingertips. I’ve enjoyed brand new games with the service, like <em>Call of the Sea</em>, and the recent addition of EA Play will help fill the <em>Star Wars</em> gap between seasons of <em>The Mandalorian</em>. At $15, it’s pricier than PS Now. But it’s cheaper than Gamefly, which is good because, with the Series S and my soon-to-arrive all-digital PS5, I can’t rent games anymore.</p>
<p>And these games run magnificently. Are most of what I’m playing from the last generation? Sure, but it’s nice to have access to these titles without any of the hiccups they might have had on previous consoles. Games optimized for Series S and Series X can be stunning, though that might have more to do with the incredible art direction employed in those titles. There’s a good chance in the near future Xbox Game Pass will stream to your computer or television like Stadia or Luna, but until that happens, the Series S is a great jumping-off point to the service.</p>
<p>Depending on what it is you want from your next-gen system, there are a few downsides to consider before buying a Series S. As stated above, it only has 364 GB of useable space built in. If you like to play a lot of AAA games, expect those file sizes to start around 45 GB. Some games, like <em>Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition</em> and <em>Quantum Break</em>, easily eclipse 100 GB each.</p>
<p>I have <em>Phantasy Star Online 2</em>, <em>Yakuza 0</em>, <em>Planet Coaster: Console Edition</em>, <em>Alan Wake</em>, <em>Minecraft Dungeons</em>,<em> Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em>, and <em>Carrion</em> currently downloaded to my console, which takes up 39% of its usable space. I’m trying to play through each Game Pass title before moving onto the next, but there are some games I’m just not going to delete from the system. <em>PSO2</em> was a 75 GB download, and there is no way in hell, with data caps, I’m going to go through that again.</p>
<p>I’ve also repeatedly run into a weird issue with streaming apps like Disney+ and HBO Max.

I can just be browsing the app itself and run into this issue.

<p>I’ve seen some speculation that Microsoft might have made too many cuts to the Xbox Series S to actually hang around this entire console generation. I don’t know if that’s true, but if this does end up being something of a “transitional console,” I’m perfectly fine with that. Because it’s giving me exactly what I want from it right now: it’s an easy gateway to those games I missed in past generations, it’s whisper silent, it’s tiny enough to fit nicely into my current television stand, and it’s letting me play all the new games, just without the Series X bells and whistles.</p>
<p>There’s really not much more that I could ask for here, other than some worthwhile, first-party titles. Those will come eventually, but until they do, I have three generations of games to keep me busy. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to download <em>Phantom Dust</em>.</p>

This thing is so small and quiet you’d think it was a student at the Milford School
One thing I’ve noticed with the past few console launches, something that became quite evident the day I preordered my Xbox Series S, is that I no longer feel the excitement I once did when moving into a new generation. Even last week, when I managed to secure an all-digital PS5 just minutes after I swore to stop trying until next year, it didn’t push me to jump for joy. I used to jump for joy picking up a new console. I remember being quite giddy standing in line at Walmart to buy the GameCube on a cold November morning.
Maybe it’s because the promise of better technology has lead to diminishing returns over the past two console generations. Maybe it’s because there are no launch titles for the Xbox Series of consoles or the PS5 that I “must play now.” Or maybe, it’s because gaming is so prolific now that it’s really all about the games rather than the hardware you choose to play them on.
Whatever it is, I do miss the excitement that comes with anticipating a new console. But with my Xbox Series S, that feeling has been replaced by something that might be just as fulfilling: the satisfaction of knowing you bought quality hardware.  I love my Series S not because I managed to buy the “hot new thing” but because this console is built so goddamn good.

And it’s so much smaller than I thought it would be. This little white box measures 10.8″ long, 5.9″ deep, and 2.5″ tall when positioned on its side. It weighs less than five pounds. You could fit two of these in an Xbox Series X with a few square inches to spare. My current entertainment center is not well suited for multiple systems, so having a Wii U, PS4 Slim, and Switch hooked up to it takes up a decent amount of usable space. Thankfully, the Series S is so small it sits comfortably next to my Wii U. And unlike my PS4 Slim, this thing is quiet.
Setting this thing up took around five minutes going through the Xbox app on my phone. With everything synced up to my Xbox account, the console scanned my television and showed me which Series S options I can and cannot use. I know this is not a new technology, as some of my fellow writers were quick to explain to me in Slack, but it did teach me more about my television and how to access HDR content on my PS4. Getting 120 fps is out of the question as my TV doesn’t support it, but I can experience 4K on video playback and with any games that support it (and yes, some games support 4K on the Series S). 
If you’re looking for a console with power, you should probably know what the Series S is packing in its petite body. Here are some of the specs:

CPU: 8x Cores at 3.6 GHz (Custom Zen 2 CPU)
GPU: 4 TFLOPS, 20 CUs @1.565 GHz
Memory: 10 GB GDDDR6
Internal Storage: 512 GB (364 GB usable)
Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby TrueHD with Atmos, DTS 5.1

In the past month, I’ve come to love just how fast the Xbox Series S gets me into my games. Quick Restart is an outstanding feature. For games that support it, it’ll get you back into the action in mere seconds rather than having to wait for a game to load.

<h2>A closed test is in the works</h2>
<p>The new <em>Freelancer</em> mode for <em>Hitman 3 </em>is getting another delay. Agent 47’s new undertaking is now aiming to launch on January 26, 2023.</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-3-road-to-freelancer/"" target=""_blank"">new blog</a> from IO Interactive details the roadmap ahead for <em>Hitman 3:</em> <em>Freelancer</em>, in a series it’s calling Road to Freelancer. The <em>Hitman </em>developer plans for several updates between now and January 26, including a closed technical test.</p>
<p>On October 6, a new patch and roadmap will arrive for <em>Hitman 3</em>. Another update on October 27 will have details about when the <em>Hitman 3: Freelancer </em>closed technical test will start and how to get access.</p>
<p>Then, in November, IO plans to host the test. More updates will arrive between then and January 26, when the game mode goes live.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/otBhG8ZldvQ?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Freelancer </em>was originally planned for earlier this year, but has faced a few delays along the way. <em>Hitman 3 </em>has still been seeing some content roll out though, with its latest location Ambrose Island <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/hitman-3-ambnrose-island-out-now-update-location-io-interactive/"" target=""_blank"">dropping in July</a>.</p>
<h2>A new way to play</h2>
<p>The upcoming <em>Freelancer </em>mode is being billed as a roguelike adaptation of the <em>Hitman </em>formula. In it, Agent 47 will have a safehouse and series of contracts to carry out. Loadouts and mission planning can be set up in advance, and equipment can be acquired or lost in the field.</p>
<p>This mode <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/hitman-3-year-2-trilogy-revealed-freelancer-rocky-game-pass-steam/"" target=""_blank"">seems like</a> a way to not just test out veteran <em>Hitman </em>players, but to add some interesting wrinkles and challenges to the existing map pool. IO says today that it’s pushed beyond its initial scope for <em>Freelancer </em>to include “almost all locations” from the World of Assassination trilogy on day one. It’s also going to be a free update for <em>Hitman 3 </em>owners.</p>
<p>So if you’ve got <em>Hitman 3 </em>on PC via Steam, you might be able to hop into the <em>Freelancer </em>test. Otherwise, it’s headed to <em>Hitman 3 </em>owners on January 26, 2023.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

But ahead of that, IO Interactive is hosting a closed technical test in November.</p>
<p>The <em>Hitman 3: Freelancer </em>closed technical test will take place on November 3 through 7. The closed technical test will only be available on PC via Steam, and it will be a separate game, with a download code delivered by IO if you’re chosen.</p>
<p>Sign-ups for the <em>Hitman 3: Freelancer </em>closed technical test <a href=""https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=KlP8MkdzTEuHsb17ojwubfabTy2vDilCm56S96K6bbxUODJESlM2MUoyS01XSFRJRFkzSTNEUFNVRS4u&amp;utm_source=IOI&amp;utm_medium=Blog"" target=""_blank"">are live here</a>.</p>
<p>We also got a pretty decently sized gameplay video today, showcasing just how <em>Hitman 3: Freelancer </em>works. The walkthrough shows off many different aspects of the roguish new mode: picking contracts, planning, touring the home base, and then setting out for a mission.</p>

<h2>Even Agent 47 is part of the gig economy</h2>
<p>The mode will pose a bunch of new challenges and options to players, based around the maps of the <em>Hitman </em>World of Assassination trilogy.</p>
<p>For the closed technical test, <a href=""https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-3-road-to-freelancer-2/"" target=""_blank"">only a select portion</a> of the pool will be available. The nine available maps are: Paris, Sapienza, Hokkaido, Miami, Mumbai, Whittleton Creek, Dartmoor, Berlin, and Mendoza.</p>
<p>The full <em>Freelancer </em>mode will have just about every map, barring three. The ICA Facility, Hawke’s Bay, and the Carpathian Mountains will be the only locales not in the full <em>Freelancer </em>launch.</p>

<p>While there is progression within the closed technical test, that mastery will not carry over to the full launch.</p>
<p>But this new way of playing <em>Hitman </em>has looked like a cool alternative for awhile now. I’m sure some players are probably eager to tinker with the possibilities in it. They’ll be getting their chance in November, ahead of the full launch at the start of the new year.</p>

<p>As you might’ve seen in the <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/wholesome-direct-2022-heartfelt-games-showcase-june-11/"" target=""_blank"">summer gaming streams</a>, there are too many frog games to keep track of this year (arguably a good problem to have!), but one of them, above all, is not leaving my sight. <em>Frogun</em> is a collectible-grabbing 3D platformer inspired by the Nintendo 64 and PS1 era, and its protagonist, Renata, wields a frog that is also a “gun.”</p>
<p>It’s a genre close to my heart, with a cute style, and I’m all about it.</p>

<h2>One big change deals with the triangle button</h2>
<p><em>God of War</em> combat is about to get a lot more interesting by the time <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/god-of-war-recap-story-ragnarok-felicia-day-mimir/""><em>Ragnarok</em></a> rolls around, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.gameinformer.com/magazine"">a new Game Informer cover story has revealed</a>.</p>
<p>So combat and mechanical changes are always on the table for an action sequel, but lead combat designers Mihir Sheth and Denny Yeh had a chance to shed some light on what that actually means for <em>God of War </em><em>Ragnarok</em> recently. “Playing with your food” is still a staple concept, which stems from an old adage from <em>God of War</em> creators, where Kratos enjoys crushing his opponents and often revels in it. Atreus will also step things up now, and is referred to as a  “powerhouse.”</p>
<p>But the biggest alterations clearly deal with Kratos, who will have access to his classic chains [Blades of Chaos] and the relatively recent battle axe [Leviathan Axe]. In what is called a “misleadingly small change” according to Sheth, the <em>God of War</em> combat system will give the triangle button more to do. As they remind us, pressing triangle in the last <em>God of War</em> entry while the axe was already in your hand did nothing (its chief purpose is recalling the axe when thrown); and using it while wielding the chains swapped to the axe. Now, the triangle button has been wholly shifted to “weapon signature moves,” which conjure up elemental attacks.</p>
<p>Fire and ice are talked about out of the gate, with two specific examples, “frost awaken and whiplash,” which have the typical fire and ice properties of immolation and frost. Shields are also touched up, with a parrying mechanic at the forefront and a red glow that showcases the right moment to strike for the Dauntless Shield, and a Stonewall Shield that doesn’t have that same parrying capability (but offers better protection, at the cost of becoming “increasingly unstable” after blocking numerous attacks).</p>
<p>In all, the team really didn’t need to change much. <em>God of War</em> mostly nailed everything already, so some tweaks to the action to “plus things up” in <em>Ragnarok</em> so to speak are ideal.</p>

While the figures have been in the company’s favor — with a year-on-year increase — Sega Sammy adjusted its forecast for the remainder of the financial year, lowering its overall expected revenue to a still impressive ¥305 billion (or roughly $2.7 billion USD).</p>
<p>For the six months leading to September 2021, Sega Sammy posted sales of ¥135 billion (or $1.2 billion), an increase of 22% on the same period in 2020. Sales were driven thanks to the very healthy Japanese sales of titles<em> Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis, Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage, Humankind, Sonic Colors: Ultimate</em> and <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown-review-ps4/"" target=""_blank""><em>Virtua Fighter 5: Ultimate Showdown.</em></a> The revenue earned from recent Sega-published releases<a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-super-monkey-ball-banana-mania/"" target=""_blank""><em> Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania</em></a> and <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-shin-megami-tensei-v/"" target=""_blank""><em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em></a> is, obviously, not included in this current report.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the report, Sega Sammy speaks of its ambitious five-year investment plan, which will see the corporation invest an estimated ¥100 billion yen ($883 million) into varying arms of the Sega Sammy family. The investment is expected to expand and strengthen the company’s video game development — particularly in <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/sega-microsoft-azure-cloud-gaming-strategic-alliance-announced/"" target=""_blank"">its cloud gaming and mobile initiatives</a> — with further funding being invested in new business endeavors for the company, including online casinos, and the already-exhausting concept of NFTs. This is an avenue that Sega has <a href=""https://www.sega.co.jp/release/210427_1.html"" target=""_blank"">already acknowledged</a> previous interest in.</p>
<p>With this statement, Sega Sammy joins a growing list of publishers currently betting on the controversial blockchain dynamic, with <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-blockchain-games-earnings-call-news/"" target=""_blank"">Ubisoft</a>, Electronic Arts, and Konami also recently citing their interest in the bizarre trend of selling and owning… well… nothin’. We can expect to see many more companies dropping NFT terminology into their respective upcoming dialogues — obviously, in big business, it’s important to hedge your bets and at least be <em>perceived</em> as being on board with the zeitgeist.</p>
<p>Whether this expensive gamble (both financially <em>and</em> ethically) <em>actually</em> becomes the future remains to be seen, but publishers are super ready ready to roll out millions of dollars in company capital in order to find out.

<h2>CEO Bobby Kotick will take a pay cut until the board determines it’s achieved its outlined goals</h2>
<p>Today, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick outlined the company’s goals in moving forward, amid several investigations into its workplace culture.</p>
<p>In an email to employees that’s been <a href=""https://www.activisionblizzard.com/newsroom/2021/10/ceo-bobby-kotick-outlines-progress-and-commitments"" target=""_blank"">shared on the Activision Blizzard site</a>, Kotick addresses the <a href=""https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-commits-expanded-workplace-initiatives"" target=""_blank"">EEOC’s investigation in particular</a>. He calls their review a “catalyst” to sharpen focus on how Activision Blizzard can change, as he apologizes for the poor workplace practices that proliferated.</p>
<p>The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-toxic-workplace-allegations-california/"" target=""_blank"">filed a lawsuit against Activision Blizzard earlier this year</a>, alleging discrimination and a toxic workplace culture at the company. Other <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/activision-blizzard-sec-investigation-report-news/"" target=""_blank"">investigations have followed</a>, and several notable employees <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/three-blizzard-devs-depart-report-activision-blizzard/"" target=""_blank"">have already departed the company</a>.</p>
<p>“The guardrails weren’t in place everywhere to ensure that our values were being upheld,” said Kotick. “In some cases, people didn’t consistently feel comfortable reporting concerns, or their concerns weren’t always addressed promptly or properly. People were deeply let down and, for that, I am truly sorry.”</p>
<p>Kotick outlines five changes coming to Activision Blizzard:</p>
<ul>
<li>A company-wide zero-tolerance harassment policy; this includes immediate termination of those found to have retaliated against anyone for compliance complaints, and termination under their zero-tolerance policy will include immediate forfeiture of future compensation.</li>
<li>An increase of women and non-binary workforce by 50%, with $250 million invested over the next decade in accelerating opportunities for diverse talent</li>
<li>Waiving required arbitration of sexual harassment and discrimination claims</li>
<li>Increased visibility on pay equity</li>
<li>Regular progress updates, including a quarterly status report</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Kotick confirms he will be taking a pay cut down to minimum salary under California law, at $62,500. He clarifies this is a reduction in overall compensation, and he’s asked to not receive any bonuses or be granted equity during this period. His total compensation will be reduced until the Board of Directors has determined the goals and commitments outlined have been achieved.</p>

CEO Bobby Kotick will take a pay cut until the board determines it’s achieved its outlined goals
Today, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick outlined the company’s goals in moving forward, amid several investigations into its workplace culture.
In an email to employees that’s been shared on the Activision Blizzard site, Kotick addresses the EEOC’s investigation in particular. He calls their review a “catalyst” to sharpen focus on how Activision Blizzard can change, as he apologizes for the poor workplace practices that proliferated.
The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a lawsuit against Activision Blizzard earlier this year, alleging discrimination and a toxic workplace culture at the company. Other investigations have followed, and several notable employees have already departed the company.
“The guardrails weren’t in place everywhere to ensure that our values were being upheld,” said Kotick. “In some cases, people didn’t consistently feel comfortable reporting concerns, or their concerns weren’t always addressed promptly or properly.

<h2>Oh really</h2>
<p>More PlayStation acquisitions? Pretty soon the entire industry will just be owned by three companies, unchecked!</p>
<p>Yep, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/sony-acquiring-bungie-destiny-studio-news/"">following the Bungie news yesterday</a>, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/1488219307188363264"">GamesIndustry.biz reporter Christopher Dring</a> spoke to Sony head honcho Jim Ryan, who noted that the Bungie deal had been in the works for “the past five or six months,” and wasn’t a reaction to Microsoft. It needed to be said, but it’s obvious these things take time!</p>
<p>But the following bit of info is more ominous and important. Dring says that Jim Ryan said to “expect more” PlayStation acquisitions beyond the Bungie news yesterday. Sony’s story is that they acquired Bungie to help make live-service multiplatform games, and hints at potential TV/movie projects for Bungie’s IP (so, <em>Destiny</em>). Bungie in turn stated that Sony “shares [their] dream and is committed to accelerating [their] creative vision of building generation-spanning entertainment.”</p>
<p>You can start with <em>Destiny 2</em>! The game has been removing (“sunsetting”) content for a while now and the expansions seemingly get smaller and smaller, content-wise, while the microtransactions pile up. While it’s clear that they have the technical knowhow to make impressive shooters (a few of the best ever made from that standpoint), they have a lot of room to grow from a leadership standpoint. And who knows? Maybe the cash injection will let them cool it on the microtransactions.</p>

Yep, following the Bungie news yesterday, GamesIndustry.biz reporter Christopher Dring spoke to Sony head honcho Jim Ryan, who noted that the Bungie deal had been in the works for “the past five or six months,” and wasn’t a reaction to Microsoft. It needed to be said, but it’s obvious these things take time!
But the following bit of info is more ominous and important. Dring says that Jim Ryan said to “expect more” PlayStation acquisitions beyond the Bungie news yesterday. Sony’s story is that they acquired Bungie to help make live-service multiplatform games, and hints at potential TV/movie projects for Bungie’s IP (so, Destiny). Bungie in turn stated that Sony “shares [their] dream and is committed to accelerating [their] creative vision of building generation-spanning entertainment.”
You can start with Destiny 2! The game has been removing (“sunsetting”) content for a while now and the expansions seemingly get smaller and smaller, content-wise, while the microtransactions pile up. While it’s clear that they have the technical knowhow to make impressive shooters (a few of the best ever made from that standpoint), they have a lot of room to grow from a leadership standpoint. And who knows? Maybe the cash injection will let them cool it on the microtransactions.

<h2>The new update is free for <em>Hitman 3 </em>owners</h2>
<p><em>Hitman 3 </em>just got some new content today, in the form of a new map and more. Ambrose Island is a new locale that’s free for any owner of <em>Hitman 3</em>.</p>
<p>The update rolls out for anyone today, so long as they own a copy of <em>Hitman 3 </em>on their platform of choice. That does include Game Pass subscription owners, according to <a href=""https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-3-ambrose-island/"" target=""_blank"">IO Interactive’s announcement</a>. The only exception is the <em>Hitman 3 </em>Free Starter Pack, which does not get access to Ambrose Island.</p>
<p>The patch rolled out at 9 a.m. ET this morning, on July 26, and is included in the patch. No need to download anything extra from the store.</p>
<p>As for what Agent 47 is getting up to in these tropical islands? Well, the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LWgJNXIOuw"" target=""_blank"">opening cinematic</a> released today can give you a clue. A former associate of Mr. Grey’s needs taking care of, and that will have to include dealing with a local pirate syndicate and disrupting a satellite connection along the way.</p>

<p>With the update, there are also some new tools and challenges. A special wetsuit and massive machete are among the rewards. There’s also a gas grenade with a poisonous frog trapped inside. And heck, even a fishing hook. Plus, new starting locations, stashes, and more await.</p>
<h2>The future of <em>Hitman</em></h2>
<p>While this brings a new locale and likely plenty of mayhem to <em>Hitman 3</em>, there’s also more in store. IO Interactive has also <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/hitman-3-ambrose-island-release-date-july-roadmap-io-interactive/"" target=""_blank"">been refreshing old content</a> as well, adding new challenges and unlockable items.</p>

It seems like the World of Assassination is not quite done with <em>Hitman </em>and Agent 47 yet. There will always be targets in need of taking down, bodies in need of a hiding place, and a runway to walk as notorious fashion icon Helmut Kruger.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

<h2>Morpheus’ conspicuous absence could be explained by an MMO from the ’00s</h2>
<p>The trailer for <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em>, a new film in <em>The Matrix </em>universe, dropped this morning. It’s a pretty exciting time for <em>Matrix </em>fans, and doubly so for those who also played <em>The Matrix Online</em>.</p>
<p>Throughout the trailer for <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em>, characters new and old appear as Keanu Reeves’ Neo contends with reality and the Matrix once more. But although both Neo and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity appear, Laurence Fishburne’s Morpheus is nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ix7TUGVYIo?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>Why is Morpheus absent? Well, if <em>The Matrix Online </em>is to be believed, it’s because he’s dead.</p>
<p><em>The Matrix Online </em>launched in 2005, as an MMO set after the events of the original <em>The Matrix </em>trilogy. It was billed as a continuation of <em>The Matrix </em>storyline, and even <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/04/11/the-matrix-online-2"" target=""_blank"">had the blessing of the Wachowskis</a> to carry on the story.</p>
<p>One major storyline beat was Morpheus attempting to get Neo’s body back from the machines, following the events of <em>The Matrix Revolutions</em>. According to various accounts, including a <a href=""https://jaowriter.net/2016/05/18/now-available-the-matrix-online-archives/"" target=""_blank"">fan-maintained archive</a> of <em>The Matrix Online</em>, Morpheus held public speeches calling for the return of Neo’s body. When this didn’t work, well, he took to more drastic measures. Namely, a sort of code bomb that would expose parts of the Matrix world to those still in it, “awakening” them.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-1474.jpg?resize=640%2C336"" alt /></p>
<p>This obviously caused a bit of a stir, and it soon came to a head. After Morpheus plants a code bomb in a water facility, a mysterious character named The Assassin shows up. At first, it seems like Morpheus has made it out alive; but then the Assassin seemingly slides out of a vent and shoots Morpheus, killing him.</p>
<p>It’s an amazingly 2005 cutscene that you definitely need to see. Here’s the cutscene, via YouTube:</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/qWPey1fU9Ok?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, there are fan theories that this was all staged. Even at the time, <em>The Matrix Online </em>players weren’t totally convinced of Morpheus’ death. Players who could enter the Matrix freely (dubbed “redpills”) were supposed to have an Emergency Jack-Out option, the reasoning for why death in the Matrix no longer meant death in real-life. Supposedly, the Assassin’s bullets contained a “kill code” that bypassed this technology, made only for very specific and extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>It’s all wild, but also fascinating. An MMO from 2005 might have significantly affected the plot for a new movie, and now is its own form of canon. Players in the game <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/2009-08-03-what-you-missed-in-the-matrix-online.html"" target=""_blank"">even held a funeral for Morpheus</a>. While it seems like the new <em>Matrix </em>movie is moving into new territory, it’s pretty fun to think that <em>The Matrix Online </em>played a part in setting the stage.</p>

It was the blurst of times…
Publisher Raw Fury, in association with developer Fury Studios, has opened up its neon yellow bum-bag and pulled out a teaser for the next entry in the strategy/building Kingdom series: Kingdom Eighties.

Currently in development for “the coolest platforms,” Kingdom Eighties: Summer of Greed will see that series visit the manic, Day-Glo vibe of 1980s Americana, utilizing a wild, Saturday Morning Show vibe to backdrop its latest bout of exploration, world-building, and conquest. While Raw Fury is keeping tight-lipped on the details, we do know that the premise of Kingdom Eighties concerns a rag-tag gang of kids and their efforts to save their neighborhood from the mysterious and titular “Greed.”
The new game will represent the fourth release in the franchise, following on from Kingdom (2015), Kingdom: New Lands (2016), and Kingdom: Two Crowns (2018). The new game will retain all of the resource-management, base-building, and combat of its predecessors, but is simply choosing to set the action in an entirely new world, one of arcade games, weekend adventures, and Denver the Last Dinosaur. Just remember to trade in your trusty steed for a BMX and you’ll be golden.
Kingdom Eighties is currently in development for PC and consoles. It is scheduled to launch in 2022.

		CMA filings show how the Activision Blizzard deal could help build the Xbox mobile store
Amid investigations over Microsoft’s possible acquisition of Activision Blizzard, new details have emerged about its plans for a mobile store to compete with other platforms.
Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal is under investigation by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). As part of those filings, Microsoft says a motivation for the acquisition is to help build out its mobile presence.
Here’s the relevant item from the CMA filing, as reported on by The Verge:
“The transaction will improve Microsoft’s ability to create a next generation game store which operates across a range of devices, including mobile as a result of the addition of Activision Blizzard’s content. Building on Activision Blizzard’s existing communities of gamers, Xbox will seek to scale the Xbox Store to mobile, attracting gamers to a new Xbox Mobile Platform. Shifting consumers away from the Google Play Store and App Store on mobile devices will, however, require a major shift in consumer behavior. Microsoft hopes that by offering well-known and popular content, gamers will be more inclined to try something new.”

A more mobile Xbox
Microsoft has been pushing more and more into the mobile market. Putting its cloud gaming service on phones makes for pretty good reasons to pick up a controller clip and game on the go.
But this new development could see Microsoft opening its own platform, one that would compete with Google’s Play Store and the App Store.
Mobile gaming revenue from Activision Blizzard is strong, as Microsoft notes in the filing. The output of the King side of Activision Blizzard, alongside games like Call of Duty: Mobile, represent a good chunk of revenue.

<h2>The NBA star can soon dunk on Bugs Bunny</h2>
<p>Warner Bros. platform fighter <em>MultiVersus </em>is adding some more combatants to its roster. LeBron is set to join the <em>MultiVersus</em> lineup on July 26, while animated duo Rick and Morty arrive as part of Season One.</p>
<p><em>MultiVersus </em>is currently in a closed alpha, but the game goes into open beta next week on July 26. LeBron’s debut will coincide with the open beta, bringing passes, dunks, and three-pointers to the melee.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that this is LeBron as he appeared in <em>Space Jam: A New Legacy</em>. Which, granted, he appeared as himself in that movie. But that means he’ll be donning the Toon Squad jersey and doing some basketball moves beyond conventional, human bounds. It seems like the main mechanic involves passing the ball around and going for big dunks.</p>

<div>
<h2>“Post-nuclear Pittsburgh”</h2>
<p>We’re getting a new update for <em>Fallout 76</em> this very week (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/fallout-76-test-your-metal-date-time-details/"">today actually!</a>), but Bethesda is already looking to September with a new look at The Pitt update.</p>
<p>As part of the Summer of Gaming festivities, we got some extra footage at the update, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/fWICWG03VJDrJlpBkg0da/fallout-76-the-pitt-gameplay-reveal"">which is now confirmed for September</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick story primer:</p>
<blockquote><p>“For the first time since <em>Fallout 3</em>, players are invited to journey back to post-war Pittsburg – now a grim industrial wasteland crippled by conflict and awash with radiation. Expeditions: The Pitt introduces a new storyline centered around two warring factions: the blue-collar freedom fighters of the Union, and the power-hungry raider faction of the Fanatics.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So the entire thing will be tied to expeditions, the public event-adjacent mechanic that was the focus of the Test Your Metal update today. We’ll also get more “tweaks and enhancements to the game,” including a tease for “adjusted gear for brand-new [players].” In addition to adding more content for endgame folks (level 50 or higher is recommended for The Pitt), we’re getting early game enhancements too. Seems smart!</p>
<p>Like every major free update for <em>Fallout 76</em> this could invigorate lapsed players, but Bethesda seems to be putting extra effort into this one on that front.</p>

“Post-nuclear Pittsburgh”
We’re getting a new update for Fallout 76 this very week (today actually!), but Bethesda is already looking to September with a new look at The Pitt update.
As part of the Summer of Gaming festivities, we got some extra footage at the update, which is now confirmed for September.
Here’s a quick story primer:
“For the first time since Fallout 3, players are invited to journey back to post-war Pittsburg – now a grim industrial wasteland crippled by conflict and awash with radiation. Expeditions: The Pitt introduces a new storyline centered around two warring factions: the blue-collar freedom fighters of the Union, and the power-hungry raider faction of the Fanatics.”
So the entire thing will be tied to expeditions, the public event-adjacent mechanic that was the focus of the Test Your Metal update today. We’ll also get more “tweaks and enhancements to the game,” including a tease for “adjusted gear for brand-new [players].” In addition to adding more content for endgame folks (level 50 or higher is recommended for The Pitt), we’re getting early game enhancements too.

<h2>Ooh, that looks like a bit of a nick</h2>
<p>Nexon might not be interested in offering us a release date, or even a platform, but it has already begun dropping character trailers for <em>DNF Duel</em>, its <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dnf-duel-dungeon-fighter-online-fighting-game-trailer-arc-system-works/"" target=""_blank"">impressive-looking fighter</a> set within the universe of popular MMO <em>Dungeon Fighter Online.</em></p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/93h5eY2BErM?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>The first <em>DNF Duel</em> character trailer takes a look at the wild Berserker, who falls into the anime trope category of “Wild, laughing madman who loves blood.” The video sees the crazy-maned maniac carving up a storm with his powerful blade, further emboldening these powers with miraculous control of his own lifeblood. A momentous and cinematic super sees Berserker conjure up a Blood Dragon to take a bite out of his hapless opponent. Our boy then has a bit of a laugh about matters. The Berserker is the first official character announcement for the <em>DNF Duel</em> roster.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dungeon-fighter-online-reveals-exciting-spin-off-fighter-dnf-duel-coming-from-arc-system-works/"" target=""_blank"">As previously reported</a>, <em>Dungeon Fighter</em> is very much an untested entity in the fighting game market, but is already off to a good start thanks to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bhnIkpCsWQ"" target=""_blank"">some attractive previews</a> — such as the above video — and has pedigree fighting game developers such as Eighting and Arc System Works in its corner. Whether the final title is able to carve out a niche among the <em>Guilty Gears</em> and<em> Street Fighters</em> of this world is up for debate, but <em>DNF Duel</em> is certainly up for the ruck and isn’t looking too shabby at all… Still, Nexon would do well to drop the most rudimentary details about the title before it continues the hype train.</p>
<p><em>DNF Duel</em> is currently in development for unknown platforms.</p>

Ooh, that looks like a bit of a nick
Nexon might not be interested in offering us a release date, or even a platform, but it has already begun dropping character trailers for DNF Duel, its impressive-looking fighter set within the universe of popular MMO Dungeon Fighter Online.

The first DNF Duel character trailer takes a look at the wild Berserker, who falls into the anime trope category of “Wild, laughing madman who loves blood.” The video sees the crazy-maned maniac carving up a storm with his powerful blade, further emboldening these powers with miraculous control of his own lifeblood. A momentous and cinematic super sees Berserker conjure up a Blood Dragon to take a bite out of his hapless opponent. Our boy then has a bit of a laugh about matters. The Berserker is the first official character announcement for the DNF Duel roster.
As previously reported, Dungeon Fighter is very much an untested entity in the fighting game market, but is already off to a good start thanks to some attractive previews — such as the above video — and has pedigree fighting game developers such as Eighting and Arc System Works in its corner. Whether the final title is able to carve out a niche among the Guilty Gears and Street Fighters of this world is up for debate, but DNF Duel is certainly up for the ruck and isn’t looking too shabby at all… Still, Nexon would do well to drop the most rudimentary details about the title before it continues the hype train.
DNF Duel is currently in development for unknown platforms.

		CMA filings show how the Activision Blizzard deal could help build the Xbox mobile store
Amid investigations over Microsoft’s possible acquisition of Activision Blizzard, new details have emerged about its plans for a mobile store to compete with other platforms.
Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal is under investigation by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). As part of those filings, Microsoft says a motivation for the acquisition is to help build out its mobile presence.
Here’s the relevant item from the CMA filing, as reported on by The Verge:
“The transaction will improve Microsoft’s ability to create a next generation game store which operates across a range of devices, including mobile as a result of the addition of Activision Blizzard’s content. Building on Activision Blizzard’s existing communities of gamers, Xbox will seek to scale the Xbox Store to mobile, attracting gamers to a new Xbox Mobile Platform. Shifting consumers away from the Google Play Store and App Store on mobile devices will, however, require a major shift in consumer behavior. Microsoft hopes that by offering well-known and popular content, gamers will be more inclined to try something new.”

A more mobile Xbox
Microsoft has been pushing more and more into the mobile market. Putting its cloud gaming service on phones makes for pretty good reasons to pick up a controller clip and game on the go.
But this new development could see Microsoft opening its own platform, one that would compete with Google’s Play Store and the App Store.
Mobile gaming revenue from Activision Blizzard is strong, as Microsoft notes in the filing. The output of the King side of Activision Blizzard, alongside games like Call of Duty: Mobile, represent a good chunk of revenue.
The acquisition remains under scrutiny though, as the CMA continues to investigate.
In other Activision Blizzard news, Blizzard Albany workers recently won approval for a union vote.

<p>The fine folk at WayForward have dropped <a href=""https://twitter.com/WayForward/status/1428401864635203589?s=20"" target=""_blank"">an exciting new update</a> for eager fans of <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/river-city-girls-2-sequel-reveal-2022-pc-consoles/"" target=""_blank""><em>River City Girls 2</em></a>, revealing new characters who are getting set to join the upcoming sequel’s playable roster. The two streetwise sluggers confirmed ready to rumble are <em>River City Ransom Underground</em>‘s Provie and <em>Double Dragon</em>‘s Marian. Rad!</p>
<p>Marian debuted in the original 1987 release of<em> Double Dragon</em> as a damsel-in-distress but has since taken to the streets to dish out her own dose of vigilante justice. Now sporting an amazing shock of white hair and some rock-hard abs, Marian appeared in the original <em>River City Girls</em> as a super-savvy shop owner — helping out Kyoko and Misako with stat-boosting supplies — but it looks like she’s getting antsy to start busting faces once again.</p>
<p>Capoeira master Provie made her <em>Kunio-kun</em> debut in 2017’s <em>River City Ransom Underground,</em> kicking ass as a member of crime-fighting troupe “The Flock”. Sporting intimidating street style and armed with acrobatic-but-devasting martial arts abilities, Provie is getting set to hit the back alleys of River City once more, laying waste to any foolhardy adversaries with her very particular brand of “break” dancing.</p>
<p>These two new additions only serve to further hype<em> RCG</em> fans, (including yer boy Moyse), for the upcoming sequel.

<h2>Extra launchers are like per-channel streaming services: not needed</h2>

<p>Basically everything will transfer from the Bethesda launcher. Saves, character progress for <em>Fallout 76</em>, atoms (microtransaction currency), seasonal progress, friends lists, the works.

<h2>Hazelight is two for two with multiplayer-only adventures and I’d love to see other developers take notes from It Takes Two</h2>
<p>After revisiting <em>A Way Out</em> a few months ago and just wrapping up <em>It Takes Two</em> over the weekend — it was surprisingly long! — it’s been tough to muster my usual enthusiasm for other co-op games.</p>
<p>I love teaming up with my girlfriend whenever and wherever our gaming interests intersect, and I know we still have countless hours left on our Year 3 farm in <em>Stardew Valley</em>, which will continue to be our go-to “unwinding” game for the near future. (We still have a few super-expensive purchases left, including two of the four warp obelisks and the Gold Clock, and I guess we’re really going for perfection?) Once we’ve tapped out, I’ll be back on my weekend routine of looking for something new for us to play.</p>
<p>A lot of the time, after flipping through stores on multiple platforms and searching in vain for Reddit recommendations, I draw a blank. “This game would be fun… but it’s online-only.” “That one looks cool, but it’s not out for a couple more months.” “I don’t know when <em>Pikmin 4</em> or <em>Overcooked 3 </em>are happening.”</p>
<p>We either resort to digging out a known favorite (<em>again</em>!) or take a chance on something iffy that one of us probably won’t like all that much — or we just do our own thing. It’s a sentiment that I think a lot of couples and families can relate to. And while I’ll often settle for okay games with reasonably decent co-op modes, I would be thrilled to see more games that follow Hazelight’s “co-op <em>only</em>” prime directive.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/It-Takes-Two-Etch-a-Sketch.jpg?resize=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""Etch a Sketch-ing is tricky with two players."" /><sub>[Image credit: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2449460001"">AηgÑ”â„“∂υÑ•Ñ‚</a>]</sub></p>
<p>Funny enough, as someone who really liked <em>A Way Out</em> in spits of its unevenness, I wasn’t sure when we’d get around to playing <em>It Takes Two</em> even though it looked like a notable step up in quality and scale. I had considered just subscribing to EA Play for a month and essentially “renting” the game, but the early word-of-mouth nudged me toward a full purchase. I don’t regret it — it’s an all-around great time.</p>
<p>The gist is that Cody and May are thinking of ending things, but their well-meaning daughter, Rose, has somehow turned them into dolls and transplanted them into a magical shrunken-down version of reality — oh, and there’s a manic sentient Book of Love to poke and prod them. One player is Cody, the other is May, and they’ll need each other’s unique (and ever-changing) abilities to get out of this jam.</p>
<p>Every inch of the game — even random interactive pieces of set decoration — feels like it was made solely with two players in mind. The designers never wanted players to fall asleep at the wheel, so you’ve both got to show up and stay focused. This isn’t a game where one player can take the lead while the other is kind of just along for the ride. That can be difficult, but the eventual payoff is rewarding.</p>
<p>One moment, you’re slinging nails into the wall so your partner can vault ahead with a hammer and smash a wall of glass bottles; during another, the two of you are firing sap at wasps and lighting them ablaze with projectile matches. The game is semi-grounded in the real world with locations from around Cody and May’s sprawling home, but the journey gets increasingly out-there and it feels like anything is on the table. I hesitate to share many specifics because a lot of the joy is seeing how many distinct gameplay mechanics Hazelight was able to cram into <em>It Takes Two</em> while still keeping it cohesive.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/It-Takes-Two-chapter-two.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""The war against the wasps is in early high point in It Takes Two."" /></p>
<p>At a certain point, I couldn’t resist checking how much of the game was left. I was shocked to see that we were six chapters in and there were still three more to go. While I don’t think <em>It Takes Two</em> needed to be as substantial as it is — actually, it could’ve been tighter with a few more trims — I’m glad it was lengthy. Even during the least interesting moments, we didn’t want our shared experience to end.</p>
<p>I particularly loved the balance between reflex-intensive boss battles and linear chase scenes, meticulous puzzles that had to be planned out, intuitive puzzles that just had to be played well, and open-ended zones where we could chill. Being able to explore in opposite directions in hub areas did wonders for the overall pacing. <em>And the mini-games</em>. I can’t believe there are 25 mini-games in here.</p>
<p>Not every facet felt inspired — some of the platforming puzzles are pretty familiar, and I was expecting something grander in the final act, for instance. I also found it tough to click with much of the story and dialogue.

Hazelight is two for two with multiplayer-only adventures and I’d love to see other developers take notes from It Takes Two
After revisiting A Way Out a few months ago and just wrapping up It Takes Two over the weekend — it was surprisingly long! — it’s been tough to muster my usual enthusiasm for other co-op games.
I love teaming up with my girlfriend whenever and wherever our gaming interests intersect, and I know we still have countless hours left on our Year 3 farm in Stardew Valley, which will continue to be our go-to “unwinding” game for the near future. (We still have a few super-expensive purchases left, including two of the four warp obelisks and the Gold Clock, and I guess we’re really going for perfection?) Once we’ve tapped out, I’ll be back on my weekend routine of looking for something new for us to play.
A lot of the time, after flipping through stores on multiple platforms and searching in vain for Reddit recommendations, I draw a blank. “This game would be fun… but it’s online-only.” “That one looks cool, but it’s not out for a couple more months.” “I don’t know when Pikmin 4 or Overcooked 3 are happening.”
We either resort to digging out a known favorite (again!) or take a chance on something iffy that one of us probably won’t like all that much — or we just do our own thing. It’s a sentiment that I think a lot of couples and families can relate to. And while I’ll often settle for okay games with reasonably decent co-op modes, I would be thrilled to see more games that follow Hazelight’s “co-op only” prime directive.

Funny enough, as someone who really liked A Way Out in spits of its unevenness, I wasn’t sure when we’d get around to playing It Takes Two even though it looked like a notable step up in quality and scale. I had considered just subscribing to EA Play for a month and essentially “renting” the game, but the early word-of-mouth nudged me toward a full purchase. I don’t regret it — it’s an all-around great time.
The gist is that Cody and May are thinking of ending things, but their well-meaning daughter, Rose, has somehow turned them into dolls and transplanted them into a magical shrunken-down version of reality — oh, and there’s a manic sentient Book of Love to poke and prod them. One player is Cody, the other is May, and they’ll need each other’s unique (and ever-changing) abilities to get out of this jam.
Every inch of the game — even random interactive pieces of set decoration — feels like it was made solely with two players in mind. The designers never wanted players to fall asleep at the wheel, so you’ve both got to show up and stay focused. This isn’t a game where one player can take the lead while the other is kind of just along for the ride. That can be difficult, but the eventual payoff is rewarding.
One moment, you’re slinging nails into the wall so your partner can vault ahead with a hammer and smash a wall of glass bottles; during another, the two of you are firing sap at wasps and lighting them ablaze with projectile matches. The game is semi-grounded in the real world with locations from around Cody and May’s sprawling home, but the journey gets increasingly out-there and it feels like anything is on the table. I hesitate to share many specifics because a lot of the joy is seeing how many distinct gameplay mechanics Hazelight was able to cram into It Takes Two while still keeping it cohesive.

At a certain point, I couldn’t resist checking how much of the game was left. I was shocked to see that we were six chapters in and there were still three more to go. While I don’t think It Takes Two needed to be as substantial as it is — actually, it could’ve been tighter with a few more trims — I’m glad it was lengthy. Even during the least interesting moments, we didn’t want our shared experience to end.
I particularly loved the balance between reflex-intensive boss battles and linear chase scenes, meticulous puzzles that had to be planned out, intuitive puzzles that just had to be played well, and open-ended zones where we could chill. Being able to explore in opposite directions in hub areas did wonders for the overall pacing. And the mini-games. I can’t believe there are 25 mini-games in here.
Not every facet felt inspired — some of the platforming puzzles are pretty familiar, and I was expecting something grander in the final act, for instance. I also found it tough to click with much of the story and dialogue. What makes It Takes Two so special is that it feels like a genuine adventure you’re sharing with another person, one you won’t soon forget. Admittedly, a lot of my co-op gaming time blurs together, but I could look at any screenshot plucked from It Takes Two and recall how we both felt in the moment.

<h2><em>Overwatch</em> died so that <em>Overwatch 2</em> could live</h2>
<p>At launch, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-overwatch/""><em>Overwatch</em></a> was a powerhouse. It was the first new real IP from Blizzard in a long time, and from beta through the first few years, it was widely beloved by many, and even lead to a burgeoning (though late) eSports scene. But then the troubles started.</p>
<p><em>Overwatch</em> became staler as the team re-used the same events, and slowed with new hero releases. Critical team members left, and Blizzard was turned upside-down by some <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-timeline-industry-ceo-bobby-kotick-report/"">egregious activities at the company</a>. Many games at Blizzard, <em>Overwatch</em> included, haven’t recovered from everything that happened.</p>
<p>Can <em>Overwatch 2</em> bring the series back into the forefront? Well, it depends on a few things.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Overwatch-review-1.jpg?resize=640%2C287&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""Early Access Review: Overwatch 2 1"" /></p>
<p><strong><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/""><em>Overwatch 2</em></a> (PC [reviewed], PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X)<br />Developer: Blizzard</strong><br />
<strong>Publisher: Blizzard</strong><br />
<strong>Released: October 4, 2022</strong><br />
<strong>MSRP: Free-to-play (with microtransactions/season pass)</strong></p>
<p>So what’s different? Here are the biggest changes for <em>Overwatch 2</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Overwatch</em> is now a 5v5 game, down from 6v6</li>
<li>Three new characters are out at launch (Sojourn, Junker Queen, Kiriko)</li>
<li>A new mode called Push is in (which asks two teams to fight over an objective), and six new maps</li>
<li>With the move to free-to-play, there’s a season pass now with a premium tier</li>
</ul>
<p>Thankfully, all of my prior stuff from <em>Overwatch</em> transferred in, even in the pre-release period. All the old cast members now have an additional “<em>Overwatch 2</em>” skin, which was unlocked by default. Although the rollout and complete wipe of the original game isn’t ideal for a number of reasons, at least this part is being done right: and the same goes for cross-progression going into <em>Overwatch 2</em>.</p>
<p>When launching into a game though, I found myself still getting used to the 5v5 format, as well as some new adjustments. A launch patch will be altering several aspects of the game, including a movement/reload buff for damage role players after they get a kill, and all heroes will refund up to 30% ultimate power on hero swap.</p>
<p>I’m sure some folks are going to butt up against it, but to me, most of the alterations felt natural. Many of the changes are a sleek way to keep the game fresh, albeit at the cost of erasing the original game from existence. Now the team has the tough challenge of rebalancing this brand new format in perpetuity (or at least until <em>Overwatch 3</em> erases <em>Overwatch 2</em>).</p>
<p>The new cast members help add to that new sense of tactical nuance. <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-2-beta-impressions-is-it-worth-it/"">I talked quite a bit about Sojourn in my beta impressions</a>, and I still feel roughly the same about her going into launch (she’s by no means going to be my main, but it’s fun to see her in games mixing things up). Junker Queen, however, brings a much-needed tank into the mix, and has an attitude to boot. Her aggressive style is going to be really appealing to a lot of players, and her commanding shout (which buffs nearby teammates) is a cool callback to barbarian/warrior playstyles. Her voice actor is also on point and fits the character well.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LGgqyer-qr4?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>Kiriko is a pretty cool support character, focusing on talismans (which can heal) and kunai as her primary source of damage. The classic intuitive <em>Overwatch</em> design is still present, as she holds her talismans on the left side of the screen (left-click) and her kunai on the right (right-click). She also has a snap-use protection charm that can make a group of teammates invulnerable for a brief moment; and sports killer traversal skills with a teleport that goes directly to an ally, and wall-climbing capabilities.</p>
<p>Her ultimate is a bit like Hanzo’s Dragonstrike, but this time it’s a kitsune that grants beneficial effects for her team. She’s interesting because she can change a single push with a well-timed invulnerability charm and her ultimate. Plus, I love climbing around every level, including all the old ones, with her wall-crawling. For me, the gameplay mostly checks out. Now it’s time to venture into darker territory.</p>
<p>The Season Pass reward track is actually much simpler than the confusing pre-launch info rollout made it seem. So presently, at least for the first season, there’s a single “battle pass” that has 80 tiers. Free players can get some rewards from it, and premium players will unlock things at every track. Purchasing levels (which some passes allow or disallow, depending on the company) is an option. Here is everything that comprises the first <em>Overwatch</em> 2 season pass free track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newest support hero, Kiriko (for new players who won’t have her already)</li>
<li>2 Epic Skins</li>
<li>1 Weapon Charm</li>
<li>2 Souvenirs</li>
<li>1 Highlight Intro</li>
<li>14 additional items (emotes, victory poses, name cards, sprays, player icons, etc.)</li>
<li>Prestige Tier Titles (8 earnable titles available only after completing the entire pass)</li>
</ul>
<p>And here’s what you get from the premium track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Immediate access to Kiriko</li>
<li>20% XP Battle Pass Boost</li>
<li>1 Mythic Skin</li>
<li>5 Legendary Skins and 1 Epic Skin</li>
<li>3 Play of the Game Intros</li>
<li>4 Weapon Charms</li>
<li>3 Emotes</li>
<li>3 Souvenirs</li>
<li>6 Poses</li>
<li>6 Name Cards</li>
<li>30+ additional cosmetic rewards</li>
</ul>
<p>To buy into the premium pass each season, it’ll cost you 1000 Overwatch Coins, or $10. Characters, “if they are included in a season pass” (not all of them will have one, as the current plan is offering characters in Season 1, Season 2, Season 4, and Season 6), will be unlocked at level 55 on the free track [this season it’s linked to Kiriko], and are unlocked automatically after buying the premium track. There’s also a shop with a limited number of items that can be purchased directly for coins. Phew! That’s most of it. Annoyed yet?</p>
<p>So there’s a lot of ways you can look at this. In short, it’s a lot like the<em> Fortnite</em> season pass system Epic created years ago, but worse. In <em>Fortnite</em>, players can earn premium currency directly from the pass itself, which will pay for the next pass. In <em>Overwatch 2</em>, you can earn coins elsewhere, but it’s expected that you’ll be able to pay for at least every other pass, roughly. For a free player, slowly clawing your way up the pass to level 55 to gain access to a new character is excruciating, even if Blizzard is locking them from ranked play for a token few weeks. For hardcore players, it seems like you’ll be dropping $10 a few times a year (with a nine-week cadence announced for seasons), which gives you instant hero access.</p>
<p>Then there’s the other wrinkle of brand new players needing to essentially start over from square one: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-2-new-players-unlock-original-roster-blizzard-news/"">including the requirement of unlocking the full original core cast</a>. Plus, an SMS Protect link will be required at launch. It was a strange “this deal is getting worse all the time” rollout of information, especially so close to the arrival of the game.</p>
<p>Everyone is going to respond differently, and I’m kind of in the middle. At face value, the season pass system is fiddly. The rewards are not really high value, the lack of currency in the pass in 2022 is disappointing, and there’s nothing unique or inherently “Overwatch” about this. In the past Blizzard may have tried to innovate in some way or mix things up, but now they are following other genre leaders. It’s already leading to some negative sentiments toward <em>Overwatch 2</em>, and we’ll be keeping an eye on it as each season progresses. Ideally — unlike 343, which went through similar growing pains with <em>Halo Infinite</em>‘s pass — some of the lesser-liked kinks are worked out sooner than later.</p>
<p><em>Overwatch 2</em> doesn’t have the same cachet that <em>Overwatch 1</em> did, but I can still see myself jumping in for a few matches after a long evening. The charm is still there, even if the delivery system has been muddled, and the game is no longer a premium product with easy-access characters that you can readily jump in and out of. Perhaps the PVE update can change that, but it has some work to do.</p>

<p><em>This post contains <strong>major spoilers for the </strong></em><strong>Uncharted<em> movie. </em></strong><em>If you still want to be surprised, come back to this one later!</em></p>
<h2>Strap in folks, this one’s a doozy</h2>
<p>I like to consider myself a pretty devout <i>Uncharted</i> fan. I’ve played all of the games, some of them multiple times, and I even worked at Naughty Dog for a hot minute there. When I heard there was going to be a movie based on the series, though, I was skeptical. Part of that is the <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@destructoid/video/7068083942594743558?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id7052788164067706373"" target=""_blank"">usual skepticism</a> that comes along with video game movies, but then there’s also the fact that <i>Uncharted</i> are some of the most movie-like games out there. Why would they need to make them into actual movies? Certainly it’s because they have their own fresh take to put on it.</p>
<p>That’s what I was thinking… at least until I saw who they cast as Nate and Sully. Look, I’m all for giving everyone a chance to prove themselves, but I was unsure of those choices from the get-go. Even if we were going for an aged-down origin story take, sure, that’s something I can get behind in theory.</p>
<figure><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-screen-02-ps4-us-09mar16.png?resize=640%2C360"" alt /><figcaption><sub>[Image Source: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end/"">PlayStation</a>]</sub></figcaption></figure>
<h3>Questionable casting</h3>
<p>Honestly, the cast was one of the most egregious things about this movie. I think the issue was that everyone just made boring choices. They were saying the lines, but there was no flavor, you know what I mean? It wasn’t giving me anything, let alone getting close to capturing the essence of these characters, who are larger than life in the games.</p>
<p>Sure, Tom Holland is an action hero type, but he’s lacking a certain maturity that’s innate to Nathan Drake. If he’s supposed to be younger, that’s fine, but he still didn’t have that charisma that we’re used to from Nate. There are moments in there where the writing is capturing Nate, for sure, but Tom’s delivery was a bit too flat for me to make it work. I’m sorry Tommy, I love you as Spider-Man, but this one’s a no from me.</p>
<p>Sully was also lacking his usual charms. Mark Wahlberg is still the worst casting choice for reasons already stated, but he also just spoke in his normal Marky Mark voice.

<h3>What is Uncharted really about? Friendship.</h3>
<p>The single worst thing about the <em>Uncharted</em> movie to me, though, is that it misses the one quintessential piece of what makes <i>Uncharted </i>what it is — it’s not the treasure, but the camaraderie. To me, <i>Uncharted</i> is just as much about people as it is about swashbuckling adventure. All anyone in this movie seems to talk about is how you can’t trust anyone because they’ll turn their back on you.</p>
<p>Then they all betray each other and it’s like, yeah no shit, that’s all you’ve talked about. Why not show me how these characters come to trust each other and become real friends, but then when the betrayals happen they actually feel like they hold some weight? Not only does the constant (and I mean <i>constant</i>) contention make the twists visible from a mile away, but it also doesn’t evolve to reveal anything new to us about the characters, or help capture the spirit of “the real treasure is the friends we made along the way” vibe that <i>Uncharted</i> always nails.</p>
<figure><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/f8bMPLkgc9bvsGQRDpJsGU.jpg?resize=640%2C352"" alt=""Tom Holland in the Uncharted movie"" /><figcaption><sub>[Image Source: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.gamesradar.com/sony-quietly-reveals-the-very-first-uncharted-movie-footage/"">GamesRadar</a>]</sub></figcaption></figure>
<h3>Who is Nathan Drake?</h3>
<p>Take Nate’s character, for example. Sure, he wants the treasure because he wants to be rich — who wouldn’t? But more than that, he grew up in a broken family, and more than anything, he wants to feel like he’s a part of something greater than himself. That’s why he and his brother hold so tightly to this idea of being descendants of Sir Francis Drake. It ties them to a family that has done great things, something they always wished they could have. Sic parvis magna, remember?</p>
<p>This idea is core to Nate’s character — it’s why he’s so proficient in treasure hunting in the first place, having studied it his whole life. It’s why when the wonders that he finds are destroyed so that they will never be able to show anyone (and monetize off of it), he brushes it off, because he loves the thrill of finding it in the first place. It’s why he is always willing to chase what he’s after to the point that it might even hurt the people he loves, which was explored at length in the story of <i>Uncharted</i> 4.</p>
<figure><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Uncharted-4-Second-Feature.jpg?resize=640%2C360"" alt /><figcaption><sub>[Image Source: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://thenerdstash.com/uncharted-movie-will-film-soon-without-a-director/"">The Nerd Stash</a>]</sub></figcaption></figure><p>Naughty Dog did a great job of fleshing out Nate’s character over the course of the game series to be more than just a bland treasure-hunting dude, and it’s what made the series shine brightest. That’s why I was so disappointed to see any similar characterization missing from the film, even in short. We get the setup that Nate and his brother think they’re Drakes, which explains their fascination with history, but that’s about all we get.</p>
<p>It’s also missing the implication that this is entirely untrue, which is what gives that idea its depth in the first place. If these characters are willing to convince themselves of an untrue lineage to connect to a feeling of greatness and a family to be proud of, that tells us a lot about who they are and the choices they make. If it’s just another fact spit out at us, it’s just exposition and nothing more.</p>
<p>Another small but incredibly important gripe I have is about the accents. Sam’s Boston accent was nowhere to be found, and that’s a huge problem for me and my roommate. It’s fun, it’s kind of his thing, and not having it that was a huge bummer. Chloe’s accent was… not good at all. She’s played by Sophia Taylor Ali, an American actress, and while she looked a great deal like Chloe (or a younger version of her), I could not distinguish what kind of accent she was going for. It changed every other line, and there were times that I couldn’t even understand what she was saying.</p>
<h3>Some positives</h3>
<p>The most enjoyable parts of the <em>Uncharted</em> movie for me were the action and puzzle sequences, for sure. There would be moments where they step away from the lousy character stuff and just focus on treasure hunting, and those were such a blast. I’m already a huge fan of this genre, so they already had me going in, but I have to admit that seeing the characters use artifacts to follow clues to solve puzzles felt more like the games than any other parts of the movie.</p>
<p>We get nods all the way through the film to iconic moments from the game, like the cargo plane set piece from <i>Uncharted 3</i> that we saw in the trailers. There’s Chloe’s introduction and a bar scene like <i>Uncharted 2</i>, but it pulls most heavily from <i>Uncharted 4 </i>with Sam, an auction scene, and the pirate ships.</p>
<figure><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/will-there-be-an-uncharted-movie-sequel-1645130688393.jpeg?resize=640%2C399"" alt /><figcaption><sub>[Image Source: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.distractify.com/p/will-there-be-an-uncharted-movie-sequel"">Distractify</a>]</sub></figcaption></figure><p>It was cool to see how the <em>Uncharted</em> movie took on some of our favorite moments from the course of the series, but with all the referencing, it often just made me wish I was playing the games instead.

When you pull them out of that format and just throw them into a blender with other vaguely <i>Uncharted</i> elements, they don’t quite have that same punch behind them. I think they would have been much better off either picking one game and adapting that, or just making an entirely original plot and going from there.</p>
<p>There was one sequence in the movie that I thought was spectacular, aside from the fact that it was the biggest set piece of the whole run.

<p>This was really the only moment in the movie where I looked at it and went, “that’s SO <i>Uncharted</i>!” It’s something I would expect to see in one of the games, but it was an entirely original set piece for the movie that had just the right amount of ridiculousness to make it feel really fun. Unfortunately it’s the only time where I felt like they took the inspiration of the games and iterated on it, giving us something original and fun, but at least I was able to enjoy it as it was happening.</p>
<h3>Fun in a bad way</h3>

Any scene where the characters were talking had me saying “I hate it,” but then we’d jump to an action scene and I’d be having a great time.

<p>The thing is, as much as I kind of hate this movie for missing some of the most important parts of its namesake, I had a really fun time watching it.

In my heart of hearts, I’m an <em>Uncharted </em>fangirl, which means I probably liked it more than someone who doesn’t care about the games would. Sadly, <i>Uncharted</i> is yet another in a long line of disappointing video game movies, and the only thing that carries it are those moments that remind us of the moments we love from the games.</p>

This post contains major spoilers for the Uncharted movie. If you still want to be surprised, come back to this one later!
Strap in folks, this one’s a doozy
I like to consider myself a pretty devout Uncharted fan. I’ve played all of the games, some of them multiple times, and I even worked at Naughty Dog for a hot minute there. When I heard there was going to be a movie based on the series, though, I was skeptical. Part of that is the usual skepticism that comes along with video game movies, but then there’s also the fact that Uncharted are some of the most movie-like games out there. Why would they need to make them into actual movies? Certainly it’s because they have their own fresh take to put on it.
That’s what I was thinking… at least until I saw who they cast as Nate and Sully. Look, I’m all for giving everyone a chance to prove themselves, but I was unsure of those choices from the get-go. Even if we were going for an aged-down origin story take, sure, that’s something I can get behind in theory.

Questionable casting
Honestly, the cast was one of the most egregious things about this movie. I think the issue was that everyone just made boring choices. They were saying the lines, but there was no flavor, you know what I mean? It wasn’t giving me anything, let alone getting close to capturing the essence of these characters, who are larger than life in the games.
Sure, Tom Holland is an action hero type, but he’s lacking a certain maturity that’s innate to Nathan Drake. If he’s supposed to be younger, that’s fine, but he still didn’t have that charisma that we’re used to from Nate. There are moments in there where the writing is capturing Nate, for sure, but Tom’s delivery was a bit too flat for me to make it work. I’m sorry Tommy, I love you as Spider-Man, but this one’s a no from me.
Sully was also lacking his usual charms. Mark Wahlberg is still the worst casting choice for reasons already stated, but he also just spoke in his normal Marky Mark voice. There was no zest, no flavor in his voice, which is a letdown from the booming presence that Sully’s gravelly voice has in the games. That’s not to say that Mark Wahlberg couldn’t have ever worked as Sully, but his white bread acting choices certainly didn’t help.
[Image Source: GamesRadar]We do get to see a credits sequence where Sully gets a mustache, and I can’t for the life of me figure out why they didn’t give him one in the movie. It makes him look so much more like the character, and they even could have written a funny quip about why he chose to grow it. Seems like a real waste of an opportunity to me.
Side note: seeing Sully’s arc reduced to “gold or friend” was honestly so laughable to me. He’s one of my favorite characters of the games — he obviously cares about the treasure, but he also has a heart of gold and we can really tell how much he cares for the people in his life. He is more than a greedy loner who just wants gold! Justice for Sully!
Chloe wasn’t my favorite either. In the games, she’s so charismatic and mysterious. In this movie, well, she’s just as boring as everyone else. I also don’t understand why they changed her backstory when the one in the game is so much cooler.

<h2>67 songs, including a bunch of boss music</h2>
<p>You can count on FromSoftware to deliver memorable music, and if you’re in an <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring/"" target=""_blank""><em>Elden Ring</em></a> mood but aren’t quite ready to commit to (yet another?) playthrough right now, you can at least soak up the vibes while going about your day-to-day. The <em>Elden Ring</em> soundtrack is now streaming on Spotify, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and other platforms — <a href=""https://bandainamco.lnk.to/Elden_Ring_ST"" target=""_blank"">here’s a handy catch-all link</a> — and at 67 songs, it’s a big collection.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/MV7IJLbKYzg?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s the obvious pick, but thinking back, I can’t shake the game’s main theme. Ahead of a long journey, it felt so empowering and ominous. Every time I would start up the game, I’d just hover there on the menu, waiting for the music to hype me back up before continuing.</p>
<p><a href=""https://blog.playstation.com/2022/09/09/elden-ring-composer-tsukasa-saito-on-creating-the-games-score-and-his-favorite-track/"" target=""_blank"">Speaking on the PlayStation Blog</a>, composer Tsukasa Saito says that the title theme — “Elden Ring” — is the track he’s “most emotionally attached to.”</p>
<p>“We spent a long time obsessing over and fine-tuning the details and tonal qualities of this piece, and I think as a result we achieved something that embodies the themes of the game, and became a strong directional pillar for the rest of the music,” Saito continued.</p>
<p>“I think we made a good piece for when players start up the game, stirring their motivation and excitement for heading out on their adventure to become Elden Lord.”</p>

67 songs, including a bunch of boss music
You can count on FromSoftware to deliver memorable music, and if you’re in an Elden Ring mood but aren’t quite ready to commit to (yet another?) playthrough right now, you can at least soak up the vibes while going about your day-to-day. The Elden Ring soundtrack is now streaming on Spotify, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and other platforms — here’s a handy catch-all link — and at 67 songs, it’s a big collection.

It’s the obvious pick, but thinking back, I can’t shake the game’s main theme. Ahead of a long journey, it felt so empowering and ominous. Every time I would start up the game, I’d just hover there on the menu, waiting for the music to hype me back up before continuing.
Speaking on the PlayStation Blog, composer Tsukasa Saito says that the title theme — “Elden Ring” — is the track he’s “most emotionally attached to.”
“We spent a long time obsessing over and fine-tuning the details and tonal qualities of this piece, and I think as a result we achieved something that embodies the themes of the game, and became a strong directional pillar for the rest of the music,” Saito continued.
“I think we made a good piece for when players start up the game, stirring their motivation and excitement for heading out on their adventure to become Elden Lord.”
Early on, the team honed in on words and phrases like “an epic tale,” “composure and resilience,” and “eloquence,” which certainly sound like themes in a Hidetaka Miyazaki game. FromSoftware wanted the Elden Ring soundtrack to “reflect the fact that this was something different from the Dark Souls series or Bloodborne,” according to Saito.

<h2>Sweet Thieves are made of these</h2>
<p>A new <em>Fall Guys </em>event is rolling in on Thursday, bringing some more <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>theming. Abstergo’s Challenge adds some new objectives to complete for prizes, while Eivor and Odin roll into the <em>Fall Guys </em>Store.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.fallguys.com/en-US/news/abstergo-challenges-fall-guys-event"" target=""_blank"">Abstergo’s Challenge</a> kicks off on July 7, with a bunch of objectives themed around the game mode Sweet Thieves. This is the mode where one team plays invisible beans, trying to steal away candy, while the guardians of the candy try to grab and capture them.</p>
<p>Beating objectives like winning as a Thief or Guardian, as well as carrying enough candy and pressing buttons, gets you points in Abstergo’s Challenge. Prizes include a title, pattern, and a shiny Apple of Eden-styled backpack.</p>

<p>Odin the All-Father and Eivor the Wolf-Kissed will also be available as costumes in the Store, at 1200 Show-Bucks apiece or 2000 for the bundle. These do cost cash, as opposed to the challenge cosmetics. Still, option’s there if you want to round out your Ezio Auditore costume from the seasonal pass with some more modern assassins.</p>
<h2>Stealth drop</h2>
<p><em>Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout </em>launched into free-to-play, landing on the Nintendo Switch, Xbox consoles, and Epic store in the process. Players have <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/fall-guys-season-pass-frustrations-fame-kudos-show-bucks/"" target=""_blank"">had some criticisms</a> of the new monetization model.</p>
<p>It’s also <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/fall-guys-free-to-play-season-one-impressions/"" target=""_blank"">been a pretty good excuse to dip back</a> into <em>Fall Guys</em>, though. Despite sharing some criticisms about the new model, I’ve still enjoyed dipping back in and playing, as the physical comedy and antics of the ultimate knockout royale hasn’t really faded for me. Free-to-play has made it easy to convince friends to hop on and try it out, too.</p>
<p>I do wonder why so much <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>stuff has been streaming into the game. It makes more sense than some other Ubisoft properties, I suppose; though I really would love to see a bean-shaped Sam Fisher.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

"Capcom angers FGC with 'Street Fighter license' esports proposal","https://www.destructoid.com/capcom-angers-fgc-with-street-fighter-license-esports-proposal/","2022-11-02T09:46:20+00:00","Taking the L Capcom has found itself in the bad books of the competitive fighting game community (FGC) after proposing an official “licensing” scheme that could potentially be applied to all Street Fighter V...","<div>
<h2>Taking the L</h2>
<p>Capcom has found itself in the bad books of the competitive fighting game community (FGC) after proposing an official “licensing” scheme that could potentially be applied to all<em> Street Fighter V</em> (and presumably <em>Street Fighter 6</em>) tournaments held anywhere on American soil, regardless of size.</p>
<p>Round 1 kicked off on February 28, when Capcom outlined its plans for the “<a href=""https://capcomprotour.com/community-license/americas/"" target=""_blank""><em>Street Fighter V Community License Agreement</em></a>“. In a nutshell, the proposed plan would require all Tournament Organizers (TOs) to apply for an official license in order to run a local or national tournament on flagship fighter<em> Street Fighter V: Champion Edition.</em></p>
<p>All TOs running <em>SFV</em> would be required to officially run the event under Capcom guidelines, with Capcom suggesting that securing an official registration will add several stages of legitimacy to the tournament, while offering a sense of “insurance” in regards to prize payouts and player behavior at the event itself. Capcom would also supply TOs with marketing assets with which to promote their event, with the TO having the prestige of hosting an “official” Capcom<em> Street Fighter</em> tournament.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As promised, I wrote an article explaining Capcom's new licensing structure, what its community event license entails, what its esports event license could mean, why it may be doing this, and what I think about it. Let me know if you have any questions!<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://t.co/RVf28XbdR3"">https://t.co/RVf28XbdR3</a></p>
<p>— Just UltraDavid (@ultradavid) <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/ultradavid/status/1498517478837612545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">March 1, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>And in the blue corner</h2>
<p>The FGC, however, does not see Capcom’s plans as being altogether wholesome. Already concerned with the opening “big brother” salvo of having a multi-million dollar company over one’s shoulder, the proposal also notes that all live streams, video, and photographs of any licensed events automatically become usable, royalty-free, by Capcom. Additionally, Capcom will have the right to limit prize pool amounts, will ban priced ticketing for spectators, ban the sale of official merchandise on-site, and could simply deny the event altogether if it does not fall within company guidelines.</p>
<p>Essentially, the FGC sees the proposal as being less about player security/safety, and instead believes that Capcom is simply trying to control the American competitive<em> Street Fighter</em> scene on all levels, from the smallest local gathering to larger, national tournaments. In response to the proposal, some TOs <a href=""https://twitter.com/JuicyGameNight/status/1498712194212577290?s=20&amp;t=_CLVhdrUARCSGdAB6HojAg"" target=""_blank"">have already announced</a> that they will simply no longer host<em> SFV</em> tournaments at their events, focusing on other fighting games instead. A later statement from Capcom has done little assuage concerns.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/capcom-sfv-licsense-response.jpg?resize=640%2C360"" alt=""capcom community licsense"" /></p>
<h2>This rings a bell…</h2>
<p>It should be noted that this all sounds incredibly familiar. Around the 2017 launch of <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-marvel-vs-capcom-infinite/"" target=""_blank""><em>Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite</em></a> — a title which Capcom was <em>convinced</em> was going to be the biggest competitive fighter of all time — <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/capcom-accidentally-releases-marvel-vs-capcom-esports-business-plan-onto-youtube/"" target=""_blank"">leaked plans for <em>MvC:I</em> events</a> featured a similar version of this licensing concept, alongside numerous other big-money plans for the competitive scene. This would not come to pass, of course, as <em>MvC:I</em>  failed to hit as a major league fighter. It seems, however, that Capcom’s plans might now be dusted off for both the twilight year of <em>Street Fighter V</em> and — likely — the incoming <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/street-fighter-6-and-capcom-fighting-collection-announced/"" target=""_blank""><em>Street Fighter 6.</em></a></p>
<p>The FGC competitive scene is<em> far</em> from perfect. I have <em>personally</em> experienced problems in regards to payouts, insults, and general poor tournament management.

Taking the L
Capcom has found itself in the bad books of the competitive fighting game community (FGC) after proposing an official “licensing” scheme that could potentially be applied to all Street Fighter V (and presumably Street Fighter 6) tournaments held anywhere on American soil, regardless of size.
Round 1 kicked off on February 28, when Capcom outlined its plans for the “Street Fighter V Community License Agreement“. In a nutshell, the proposed plan would require all Tournament Organizers (TOs) to apply for an official license in order to run a local or national tournament on flagship fighter Street Fighter V: Champion Edition.
All TOs running SFV would be required to officially run the event under Capcom guidelines, with Capcom suggesting that securing an official registration will add several stages of legitimacy to the tournament, while offering a sense of “insurance” in regards to prize payouts and player behavior at the event itself. Capcom would also supply TOs with marketing assets with which to promote their event, with the TO having the prestige of hosting an “official” Capcom Street Fighter tournament.

As promised, I wrote an article explaining Capcom's new licensing structure, what its community event license entails, what its esports event license could mean, why it may be doing this, and what I think about it. Let me know if you have any questions!https://t.co/RVf28XbdR3

And in the blue corner
The FGC, however, does not see Capcom’s plans as being altogether wholesome. Already concerned with the opening “big brother” salvo of having a multi-million dollar company over one’s shoulder, the proposal also notes that all live streams, video, and photographs of any licensed events automatically become usable, royalty-free, by Capcom. Additionally, Capcom will have the right to limit prize pool amounts, will ban priced ticketing for spectators, ban the sale of official merchandise on-site, and could simply deny the event altogether if it does not fall within company guidelines.
Essentially, the FGC sees the proposal as being less about player security/safety, and instead believes that Capcom is simply trying to control the American competitive Street Fighter scene on all levels, from the smallest local gathering to larger, national tournaments. In response to the proposal, some TOs have already announced that they will simply no longer host SFV tournaments at their events, focusing on other fighting games instead. A later statement from Capcom has done little assuage concerns.

This rings a bell…
It should be noted that this all sounds incredibly familiar. Around the 2017 launch of Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite — a title which Capcom was convinced was going to be the biggest competitive fighter of all time — leaked plans for MvC:I events featured a similar version of this licensing concept, alongside numerous other big-money plans for the competitive scene. This would not come to pass, of course, as MvC:I  failed to hit as a major league fighter. It seems, however, that Capcom’s plans might now be dusted off for both the twilight year of Street Fighter V and — likely — the incoming Street Fighter 6.
The FGC competitive scene is far from perfect. I have personally experienced problems in regards to payouts, insults, and general poor tournament management. But I wholly understand the TOs concerns here. Aside from the ownership of assets and the dictatorial nature of rules and pricing, Fighting games have always been built on their communal “grassroots” mentality. Capcom’s proposals arguably risk implementing control and a sense of corporate capitalism at even the smallest, most private of events.
The FGC has always been proud of its “homegrown” “street” mentality, and while the scene certainly needs to see better moderation and player security, having the biggest fighting game publisher in the world breathing down your neck — while simultaneously handing over all of your scene’s assets to them, free-of-charge, might not be the way to inspire confidence and trust between either party.

<h2>Seasonal updates every nine weeks</h2>
<p>During the <em>Overwatch 2</em> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTUX1zacoZ4"" target=""_blank"">Reveal Event</a> this morning, Blizzard elaborated (somewhat!) on its free-to-play launch and what’s in the content pipeline for this live-service sequel.</p>
<p>If you’ve been waiting to hear more about PvE, welp, that wasn’t the focus of today’s stream — and the new story missions won’t be playable until 2023 — but we’ve got a roadmap for PvP and confirmation that <strong>loot boxes are out</strong> and a battle pass format is in.</p>
<p>Coming off of <em>Overwatch</em><em> 1</em>, the team’s main goal is to try and deliver content on a “frequent and consistent basis,” according to game director Aaron Keller.</p>
<p>Currently, they’re committing to major updates every nine weeks, starting with the launch on October 4. “Players can expect to see a new hero every other season, with elements like new maps and game modes in the seasons between,” <a href=""https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/overwatch/23814218/overwatch-2-reveal-event-recap"" target=""_blank"">Blizzard said in a blog post</a>.</p>
<h2>The 2022 roadmap and a tease for 2023</h2>

<p>As you can see from this roadmap, Season 1 of <em>Overwatch 2</em> will be out on October 4 with three new heroes — Sojourn, Junker Queen, and a new support hero, who Blizzard teased with a snippet of footage featuring a spirit fox. It’ll also be the debut of Push mode, six new maps, and more than 30 character skins, including a new Mythic tier of skins.</p>
<p>The first example of a Mythic skin was a cool Cyber Demon skin for Genji with customization elements like tattoos, masks, and colors. I’m… intrigued! And also worried about how much Mythic skins will cost (whether that’s actual money or time invested).</p>

<p>Other new cosmetics, like banners and weapon charms, will help pad out the battle pass; one example was a little frosted donut keychain. There will be a shop with virtual currency.</p>
<h2>Cross-progression</h2>
<p>Crucially, with all of this new Stuff for players to stockpile, Blizzard said that if you earn something on console, PC, or in <em>Overwatch 1</em>, you can use it in <em>Overwatch 2</em>. In other words, there’s cross-platform progression, which is definitely something they had to deliver. That said, the first <em>Overwatch 2</em> battle pass won’t be ready until Season 2 starts on December 6. After all this time, the launch — well, the “rollout,” really — sure seems gradual.</p>

<h2>Competitive</h2>
<p>Starting with Season 1 on October 4, <em>Overwatch 2</em> will have “a reimagined competitive experience that was created to give players more tools to improve gameplay and feel a sense of progression in competitive play,” according to Blizzard. “Players will have more of an impact on individual matches with the shift to 5v5, and there will be additional systems in place to help you discern your contributions per match.”</p>
<h2>Where’s PvE?</h2>
<p>As for <em>Overwatch 2</em> PvE, we got a few gameplay glimpses of Null Sector’s return and some fairly open-ended developer quotes about the team’s ambitions.</p>
<p>“With PvE, we have an opportunity to go a step further, to go deeper into diverse storytelling in ways that we really just haven’t been able to before,” said Keller. It’ll be delivered starting in 2023 “through the live service,” just like the PvP content. The team plans to show off (more of) where the characters are from in these PvE “experiences.”</p>
<h2>Beta sign-ups</h2>
<p>A new map, Rio, and Junker Queen, will be playable in the <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-2-console-pc-playstation-xbox-pvp-beta-starts-june-28/"" target=""_blank""><em>Overwatch 2</em> closed beta</a> starting on June 28. <a href=""https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/beta/"" target=""_blank"">Beta sign-ups are now available</a> for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>

Seasonal updates every nine weeks
During the Overwatch 2 Reveal Event this morning, Blizzard elaborated (somewhat!) on its free-to-play launch and what’s in the content pipeline for this live-service sequel.
If you’ve been waiting to hear more about PvE, welp, that wasn’t the focus of today’s stream — and the new story missions won’t be playable until 2023 — but we’ve got a roadmap for PvP and confirmation that loot boxes are out and a battle pass format is in.

<p>They did it! They finally got me to play a Netflix-backed video game. That’s the allure of something new from Ojiro Fumoto, the creator of <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-downwell/"" target=""_blank""><em>Downwell</em></a>. The designer’s last game was about strategically plummeting, and this new one, <em>Poinpy</em>, is about going up, up, up.</p>

<p>If this is your first time, here’s how it works: you can download <em>Poinpy</em> as a standalone app on <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.Poinpy"" target=""_blank"">Android</a> or iOS, but to play it, you’ll need a Netflix subscription (or someone’s login). After launching the game, it’ll ask you to sign into Netflix — and even choose your individual profile if you’re sharing your sub — before playing. In other words, it’s a self-contained experience and you don’t even need the main Netflix app on your mobile device.</p>
<p>As the trailer shows, the idea is to flick your character upwards with a bit of a time crunch to keep the pressure on. You’ll try to avoid accidentally colliding with foes while collecting certain combinations of fruit and climbing ever higher until your run comes crashing down and you go again. Much like <em>Downwell</em>, this quick-on-your-feet game is about being in the right place at the right time to keep your momentum flowing seamlessly without snags.</p>

		CMA filings show how the Activision Blizzard deal could help build the Xbox mobile store
Amid investigations over Microsoft’s possible acquisition of Activision Blizzard, new details have emerged about its plans for a mobile store to compete with other platforms.
Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal is under investigation by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). As part of those filings, Microsoft says a motivation for the acquisition is to help build out its mobile presence.
Here’s the relevant item from the CMA filing, as reported on by The Verge:
“The transaction will improve Microsoft’s ability to create a next generation game store which operates across a range of devices, including mobile as a result of the addition of Activision Blizzard’s content. Building on Activision Blizzard’s existing communities of gamers, Xbox will seek to scale the Xbox Store to mobile, attracting gamers to a new Xbox Mobile Platform. Shifting consumers away from the Google Play Store and App Store on mobile devices will, however, require a major shift in consumer behavior. Microsoft hopes that by offering well-known and popular content, gamers will be more inclined to try something new.”

A more mobile Xbox
Microsoft has been pushing more and more into the mobile market. Putting its cloud gaming service on phones makes for pretty good reasons to pick up a controller clip and game on the go.
But this new development could see Microsoft opening its own platform, one that would compete with Google’s Play Store and the App Store.
Mobile gaming revenue from Activision Blizzard is strong, as Microsoft notes in the filing. The output of the King side of Activision Blizzard, alongside games like Call of Duty: Mobile, represent a good chunk of revenue.
The acquisition remains under scrutiny though, as the CMA continues to investigate.
In other Activision Blizzard news, Blizzard Albany workers recently won approval for a union vote.

<p>The REDstreams branding, however, might indicate we could still hear about other projects.

<p>As for <em>2077</em>, post-launch support has been carrying on. It’s likely CD Projekt Red will take the time on stream to talk about the next-gen version of <em>Cyberpunk</em> <em>2077</em>, since the latest expectations for that <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/cyberpunk-2077-and-witcher-3-next-gen-updates-on-track-for-2022/"" target=""_blank"">were set for Q1 2022</a>. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S version would be the console’s own version of the open-world cyberpunk game, and <em>Wild Hunt </em>is expected to get its own version on those consoles sometime in Q2 2022.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s also the DLC for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> that’s expected to arrive at some point. There’s still a lot of <em>Cyberpunk </em>to roll out, and it seems like we might start hearing about it pretty soon. Maybe this can start the right the ship after a very rough launch.

<h2>Rock and Roll All Nite</h2>
<p>Are you adequately prepared to rock? Arc System Works sure hopes so, as next week will see the publisher launch an open beta to test the rollback netcode update for its excellent anime fighter <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-guilty-gear-xrd-rev-2/"" target=""_blank""><em>Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2</em></a> — The beta will kick off October 17 on the Steam release of the 2017 smasher.</p>
<p>While ArcSys is currently enjoying the fruits of more recent entry <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-guilty-gear-strive/"" target=""_blank""><em>Guilty Gear Strive</em></a>, its predecessor is still tightly-held by many of the <em>GG</em> faithful as one of, if not the, finest entry in the long-running fighting game franchise. Recognizing this, the developer is taking steps to ensure that those players who still wish to party like it’s 2017 are afforded the best experience available, with the same silky smooth netcode that younger brother <em>GG Strive</em> offers.</p>
<p>To get folks in gear (pun fully intended) for the beta, ArcSys is also holding a slew of discounts on the <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/520440/GUILTY_GEAR_Xrd_REV_2/"" target=""_blank""><em>Guilty Gear</em> Steam back catalog</a>. New and veteran players can bag several titles including <em>Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2, Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R,</em> and <em>BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle</em>, alongside their respective DLC, for hugely discounted prices. It should be noted that none of these games feature the <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/guilty-gear-strive-testament-trailer-dlc-arc-system-works/"" target=""_blank"">new and improved version of Testament,</a> but Baiken and Bridget<em> are</em> in the mix, so they’re well worth your dollarydoos.</p>
<p>Prepare to meet Elphelt. Be very afraid.</p>
<p><em>Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2</em> is available now on PS4 and PC. The rollback netcode beta test will take place from October 17 to October 31. In addition, <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> is available now on PlayStation and PC platforms, with an <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/guilty-gear-strive-xbox-spring-2023-port-arc-system-works-tgs/"" target=""_blank"">Xbox port arriving in spring 2023.</a></p>

Rock and Roll All Nite
Are you adequately prepared to rock? Arc System Works sure hopes so, as next week will see the publisher launch an open beta to test the rollback netcode update for its excellent anime fighter Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2 — The beta will kick off October 17 on the Steam release of the 2017 smasher.
While ArcSys is currently enjoying the fruits of more recent entry Guilty Gear Strive, its predecessor is still tightly-held by many of the GG faithful as one of, if not the, finest entry in the long-running fighting game franchise.

“We are acting in good faith and asking for good faith.”
Quality assurance workers at Raven Software are ending their strike. The group, which had been striking for several weeks, is ceasing their work stoppage following a vote to unionize last week.
Raven’s QA testers had been on strike in response to the sudden announcement of layoffs. The group announced last week that it had held a successful vote to unionize under the Communication Workers of America (CWA) as the Game Workers Alliance (GWA).

Pending the recognition of our union, the Raven QA strike has ended. Unused strike funds are being stored for future organizing/strike efforts.
We'll post or retweet any GWU updates here. Appreciate all the community support throughout the strike!

The workers are now calling on Activision Blizzard to voluntarily recognize their union. Through the ABK Workers Alliance, they made a statement about ending the strike: “We are acting in good faith and asking for good faith.”

<h2>Send heroes flying off the map</h2>
<p>I was thinking I was probably done with the <em>Overwatch 2</em> beta for now as a support main, but after hearing about a couple of hero ability shakeups, I had to check back in. My boy, Zenyatta, has an overturned new Snap Kick and I’m going to super enjoy it while it lasts.</p>
<p>Our transcendent omnic can send opponents flying off the edge with <strong>Snap Kick</strong>, a new passive ability that increases quick melee damage by 50 percent and also “significantly” increases knockback. After seeing a funny demonstration on Reddit, I tested it out, and sure enough — I was able to take out a Wrecking Ball with Zenyatta’s full-throttle kick.</p>

<p>This silly move shouldn’t be that all noteworthy, but Zenyatta was my favorite character early on in <em>Overwatch</em> and I’m happy to see a gameplay twist, doubly so in the overly familiar <em>Overwatch 2</em> beta. It’s also interesting in the context of what Blizzard was <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-2-beta-feedback-make-support-heroes-more-enticing/"" target=""_blank"">recently saying about needing to make</a> support characters more “attractive” compared to the tank and damage roles. “New” and “refreshed” abilities can liven them up. More, please.</p>
<p>“This is legit the best change in a long time IMO,” <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/uj4ec6/zen_has_significant_knockback_on_his_kick/i7gyeex/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3"" target=""_blank"">said one player on Reddit</a>. “I wish we got more stuff like this, kinda silly changes but they’re fun.

<p>It’s a common sentiment at this point, at least in my circles. It’ll be hard to shake.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the <em>Overwatch 2</em> beta update, Roadhog — another early favorite I’d love to pick up again — got a rework to his ultimate, Whole Hog. Now, it’s a “transform” ultimate, not a “channeled” ultimate, so Roadhog players can choose when to fire and use “normal abilities” without canceling Whole Hug. Stuns won’t cancel it out, either.</p>
<p>Blizzard also adjusted Soldier: 76 to have a “more interesting” ultimate — now, Tactical Advisor “allows for critical hits, if a shot would have been a critical hit outside his ultimate.”</p>
<p>I also feel like it’s worth noting that newcomer Sojourn’s railgun alt-fire has a wider projectile as of this update. According to Blizzard, the designers “saw a lot of players at varying skill levels struggling to land shots.” I <em>may</em> be lumped in that group.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

Just this week, we were reminded by Super Smash Bros. boss Masahiro Sakurai that the “daily Smash screens” fun was coming to an end.

World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King Classic launches globally today and Destructoid sister site Icy Veins is here to tell you all about it, including an assortment of guides.
Global Release Times
Wrath Classic launches in the Americas, Europe, Taiwan, Korea, and Australia/New Zealand simultaneously. Check the details below for the exact time you can log in to the game and explore all that the new expansion has to offer.

What’s New?

New Continent: Northrend – Heroes will begin their journey in one of two zones in Northrend — Borean Tundra or Howling Fjord. A vast new continent awaits!
New Hero Class: Death Knights – Available to both factions at Level 55, Death Knights harness the powers of darkness to help combat the evil that threatens Azeroth. In Wrath Classic, Blizard is bypassing the requirement for a player’s first Death Knight character, unless they decide to pick a fresh realm.
New Profession: Inscription – Scribe mystical glyphs that modify the properties of spells and abilities or create powerful trinkets and off-hand items.
Achievements – Show off your accomplishments and earn various rewards in WoW Classic!
Dungeons &amp; Raids – Multiple new dungeons and 3 raids will be available during Phase 1.

Wrath of the Lich King Classic is included with existing World of Warcraft subscriptions. If you subscribe to World of Warcraft, you can also play Wrath of the Lich King Classic at no additional cost.

New Hero Class: Death Knight
Death Knights are a new Hero Class available in Wrath Classic. They start at Level 55 in Ebon Hold and have 3 specializations to choose from: Blood, Frost, and Unholy. You do not need an existing Level 55 character on the same realm to create your first Death Knight in Wrath Classic. Fresh start realms are an exception to the rule. Any Death Knight created after your first one must be on a different realm, and requires an existing Level 55 character on the same realm. Completing the Death Knight intro in Wrath Classic rewards the Frostbrood Proto-Wyrm mount on live servers.
If you’re playing a Death Knight in Wrath Classic, we have a set of guides specifically tailored to help you with leveling, gearing, talents, addons, and macros.
Death Knight PvE &amp; PvP Guides
Death Knight Gear Guides
Talent Guides
Inscription is a new Profession that lets you craft powerful items called glyphs that enhance spells and abilities. Scribes can create various trinkets and off-hand items.


We’ve all been there! It is always difficult to choose a class, especially in an MMORPG like World of Warcraft, and when you finally decide which class to play, it’s time to start leveling! The cap has been raised to Level 80 in Wrath Classic (up from Level 70 in Burning Crusade Classic).
If you do not plan on maining a Death Knight, we have leveling guides for other classes as well with recommended builds and talents.

Rankings in Wrath Classic Phase 1
Our guide writers have prepared Tier Lists for Wrath Classic Phase 1 that we sort by player role (DPS, Healer, Tank) and content type (PvE/PvP/Arenas). Find out more about how each class performs in a different type of scenario.

Dungeons
Twelve new dungeons are available at Wrath Classic launch with four more coming in later phases.
Professions
The new maximum skill cap for all professions is raised to 450. In Wrath Classic, professions offer various bonuses to your character. Our profession guides provide you with clear instructions on how to effectively level up your professions and reach the max cap.


Reputations
A total of 10 reputations await in Wrath Classic at launch with more coming in later stages. Alliance Vanguard and Horde Expedition are specific to a single faction. Conversely, all the other reputations are shared between both factions. You must interact with them by completing quests and reach Exalted reputation standing to earn Profession recipes, mounts, and gear.

<h2>The support role isn’t “attractive” enough</h2>
<p>As easy as it is to want more — <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-2-beta-impressions-is-it-worth-it/"" target=""_blank"">much more</a> — from the <em>Overwatch</em> <em>2</em> beta, especially after a long wait, it’s far from done. <a href=""https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/overwatch/23801625/overwatch-2-pvp-beta-week-1-developer-blog"" target=""_blank"">In a blog today</a>, Blizzard said it will add “more content including heroes, maps, and features” leading up to the full PvP release.</p>
<p>The <em>Overwatch 2</em> team reiterated that this initial PvP beta is focused on “[the new 5v5] gameplay and balance as well as stability,” meaning other aspects — “like menu screens, player profiles, multiple time of day conditions for classic maps, and the full set of hero 2.0 looks” — are progressing behind-the-scenes but aren’t being tested publicly yet.</p>
<p>The blog runs through a bunch of player feedback, much of which has to do with drawn-out queue times for support players, the lack of a Ranked mode in the beta, and the scoreboard that’s a more nitty-gritty look at individual players’ performances. On that last point, player medals are out, but the “<a href=""https://overwatch.fandom.com/wiki/On-fire_Meter"" target=""_blank"">Fire</a>” mechanic could still live on with tweaks.</p>
<h2>A solution for lengthy queue times</h2>
<p>If you’re growing impatient over those lengthy role queue times, Blizzard says it’s readying “<strong>quick play classic</strong>” with an open queue in <em>Overwatch 2</em>, and it’ll be an “easy option for the remainder of the first Beta test.” And if you’re not into the beta, future updates might help.</p>
<p>For some players, the 5v5 format is a much-needed shakeup, and it’s nice to see characters like <a href=""https://www.pcinvasion.com/overwatch-2-beta-orisa-guide-abilities-changes-tips-counters-and-more/"" target=""_blank"">Orisa</a> become more capable. Some of the “refreshed” kits are neat; you should’ve seen the look on my face when I popped Bastion’s new artillery-strike Ultimate.</p>
<p>On the flip side, as a support player, the <em>Overwatch 2</em> beta hasn’t made a splash <em>at all</em>. I’m not going to uninstall it or anything (not yet), but I already feel like I’ve had my fill of the current content after a down-the-list training session and just a few live matches.</p>
<p>On that front, Blizzard recognizes the “need to make playing support more attractive to players” — although it also feels that, across the board, “most heroes are falling into a healthy range overall for play rate and win rate across different skill levels.”</p>
<p>For the time being, I’m glad that Moira is in my wheelhouse.</p>

<h2>It’s about more than just “balance”</h2>
<p>There’s a lot to take in, so feel free to skim the key takeaways (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>“More broadly, during our Alpha test, we observed support heroes feeling too vulnerable to diving and flanking attacks with fewer shields and no second tank focusing on protecting them. We made a significant adjustment to their role passive heading into Beta, allowing support heroes to recover more health faster and improve their survivability.</p>
<p>This change improved their overall power and durability, and <strong>overall supports are performing well</strong> in the Beta, but we know that <strong>balance is only one aspect of what makes a hero fun to play</strong>. We have heard clearly that support players feel both tanks and damage players have more new content to enjoy and explore in this Beta.</p>
<p>Longer term, we believe the most effective way to tackle this issue is to <strong>add exciting new support heroes</strong> to the game, and that is part of our plans. In the near term, our hero design team is also experimenting with significant, but shorter lead time, ideas including <strong>new and refreshed abilities for some existing support heroes</strong>. These types of ideas could be deployed later this first Beta test but more likely would be in our next test.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope these plans come to fruition, as they’d help pull me back into <em>Overwatch 2</em> — well, the beta, anyway. I’m sure the final PvP component will come together through brute force if nothing else, but it’s kind of tough to picture it as a compelling, energizing, long-lasting experience based on the way <em>Overwatch 1</em> petered out for me and the way <em>Overwatch 2</em> has unceremoniously entered the world with this first PvP beta.</p>
<p>At this point, I’m not expecting <em>Overwatch</em><em> 2</em> to magically capture lightning in a bottle again. I keep telling myself not to! But it’s tough. So much can change in <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-overwatch/"" target=""_blank"">six years</a>. <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-timeline-industry-ceo-bobby-kotick-report/"" target=""_blank"">So much</a>.</p>

The support role isn’t “attractive” enough
As easy as it is to want more — much more — from the Overwatch 2 beta, especially after a long wait, it’s far from done. In a blog today, Blizzard said it will add “more content including heroes, maps, and features” leading up to the full PvP release.
The Overwatch 2 team reiterated that this initial PvP beta is focused on “[the new 5v5] gameplay and balance as well as stability,” meaning other aspects — “like menu screens, player profiles, multiple time of day conditions for classic maps, and the full set of hero 2.0 looks” — are progressing behind-the-scenes but aren’t being tested publicly yet.

<h2>But Nexon still dark on platforms and date</h2>
<p>Publisher Nexon has released a dazzling gameplay trailer for its upcoming release <em>DNF Duel</em>, a one-on-one fighting game set within the universe of Korean RPG <em>Dungeon Fighter Online</em>. Developed by scrapper-lovers Arc System Works and Eighting, the anomaly is looking damn fine at this early stage, though Nexon is <a href=""https://twitter.com/DNFDuel"" target=""_blank"">yet to offer further details</a> on the release.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/7bhnIkpCsWQ?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>As you can see from the 45-second preview above, <em>DNF Duel</em> features the electrifying action and lush anime visuals that ArcSys brings to its array of fighting titles — which include <em>Guilty Gear, Dragon Ball FighterZ,</em> and<em> BlazBlue</em>. The video sees famous <em>Dungeon Fighter Online</em> heroes engage in what <em>appears</em> to be “Rush”-based combat, (as in, simplified combo strings and special systems), while also showcasing an array of flashy and cinematic super moves. We first reported on the spin-off title <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dungeon-fighter-online-reveals-exciting-spin-off-fighter-dnf-duel-coming-from-arc-system-works/"" target=""_blank"">almost one year ago</a>, so it’s cool to finally see the slugger in action.</p>
<p>While huge in its native South Korea, <em>Dungeon Fighter Online</em> (<em>DFO</em>) does not have quite the same global audience, and as such <em>DNF Duel</em> will need to shine a lot of light on its cool visuals and characters, while delivering excellent combat, if it is to stand toe-to-toe with some of the genre’s behemoths on a global basis. I gotta admit, I’m intrigued, this is a pretty spectacular trailer, and I’ll be keeping my eye on this title as it edges closer to fruition. Whenever that may be.</p>
<p><em>DNF Duel</em> is currently in development for unspecified platforms.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal is <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-under-uk-regulator-investigation-news/"" target=""_blank"">under investigation</a> by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).

Microsoft has been pushing more and more into the mobile market. Putting its cloud gaming service on phones makes for pretty good reasons to pick up a controller clip and game on the go.
But this new development could see Microsoft opening its own platform, one that would compete with Google’s Play Store and the App Store.
Mobile gaming revenue from Activision Blizzard is strong, as Microsoft notes in the filing. The output of the King side of Activision Blizzard, alongside games like Call of Duty: Mobile, represent a good chunk of revenue.
The acquisition remains under scrutiny though, as the CMA continues to investigate.

<p>Riot Games announced on Monday that <a href=""https://www.upcomer.com/riot-games-will-pay-100-million-in-settlement-of-discrimination-lawsuit/"" target=""_blank"">it will agree to settle</a> a 2018 class-action suit with California state agencies and female employees for $100 million.</p>
<p>The <em>League of Legends </em>publisher agrees to pay $80 million to members of the class-action suit, made up of current and former women who worked at the company full-time or as a contractor since November 2014. An additional $20 million will be paid toward legal fees and expenses, per <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/riot-games-agrees-pay-100-mln-settle-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-2021-12-28/"" target=""_blank"">Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement Riot Games will also commit to having its internal reporting and pay equity processes monitored by a third party.

The League of Legends publisher agrees to settle the 2018 class-action suit
Riot Games announced on Monday that it will agree to settle a 2018 class-action suit with California state agencies and female employees for $100 million.
The League of Legends publisher agrees to pay $80 million to members of the class-action suit, made up of current and former women who worked at the company full-time or as a contractor since November 2014. An additional $20 million will be paid toward legal fees and expenses, per Reuters.
As part of the settlement Riot Games will also commit to having its internal reporting and pay equity processes monitored by a third party. This party will be jointly approved by Riot Games and the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, and will review complaint investigations and outcomes over three years.

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

We’re coming home in 2022
Today’s Nintendo Direct ended with the game we’ve been waiting to see for too long. In Yoshiaki Koizumi’s own words, “We announced this game in 2017, and we thank you for your patience. This game will launch next year.” Why yes, it’s none other than Bayonetta 3!
“After what seems like 500 years, we’re proud to finally show the trailer,” said Platinum.

More than anything, I’m most stoked about the continuation of this wild, witchy world. We love this studio for its top-tier action gameplay, and I’d put Bayonetta in that bucket. I also really like the story, which seems like it’s ~going places~. I need to consult the lore.

<h2>Bookmark this for when you want a new reward</h2>
<p><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/this-my-nintendo-christmas-ornament-came-at-a-perfect-time-611878.phtml"" target=""_blank"">With My Nintendo physical rewards popping up like daisies every week</a>, I’ve had a ton of requests from readers to explain what Platinum Points are, and how to earn them quickly. Here’s a My Nintendo points guide.</p>
<p>It’ll walk you through the entire process comprehensively, from starting a My Nintendo account to some of the more advanced ways of earning digital bread.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/MyNintendoPointsGuide.jpg?resize=640%2C235&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<h2><strong>My Nintendo points guide basics: Make an account, then grab all the easy missions first</strong></h2>
<p>As a recap, “Platinum” is basically a make-believe currency that lets you earn small rewards in mobile titles (don’t do this, it’s a waste) or digital rewards, like 3DS themes and game discounts for non-Switch systems. As you can clearly see, the latter use is outdated, and has been for some time, basically putting My Nintendo in a dormant state. But with physical rewards arriving recently, it’s given the service a second wind.</p>
<p>So this step is the easiest. <a href=""https://my.nintendo.com/missions"" target=""_blank"">Go make a My Nintendo account</a>, then link your proper Nintendo account. Head to the “missions” section: this is your dashboard, where you’ll start making notes of what to do to earn Platinum Points.</p>
<p>Make a few quick changes to get some easy points. Link your Nintendo account, turn promotional emails on (and keep them on for recurring points), and link various social accounts (Facebook/Google/Twitter) for more points. If you’re uncomfortable with this prospect, link bogus accounts. Also don’t forget to tour the Mario 35 site and click around for more easy points.</p>
<p>The Cold Stone code is an odd one, but an option. You can get 100 points if you order a <em>Mario</em>-themed menu item, and the best way to do that without incident is online. Make a Cold Stone account, then order an item ahead of time for pickup. Make sure the “My Nintendo” promo is enabled. Some folks are reporting that it works online for all menu items as long as the code is applied (even the cheapest menu items possible, like sides), but do this at your own risk. My wife ordered a Mario shake online, and we were able to do curbside pickup: the point code was emailed to me a few hours later. <a href=""https://mario.nintendo.com/missions/"" target=""_blank"">Enter it here</a>.</p>
<p>Another source of recurring points is the “monthly Nintendo newsletter.” Note that sometimes you’ll be required to locate a number code in the actual email, <a href=""https://my.nintendo.com/serial_number"" target=""_blank"">which can be redeemed for points on this page</a>. Emails can appear sporadically or not at all, so keep an eye out for them.</p>
<p><strong>When you actually use the points</strong>, you’re basically “buying” a digital code. You use that code to make the item free: then pay shipping (which is around $5). Use this opportunity to stack items together, as one purchase only incurs one flat shipping fee. In other words, you can amass points through this guide and spend them all at once.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/MyNintendoPlatinumGuide3.jpg?resize=640%2C312&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<h2><strong>Know the weekly resets</strong></h2>
<p>Every Monday, My Nintendo will allow you to click on your avatar on the homepage to earn a quick 30 Platinum Points. <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/don-t-forget-to-sign-into-the-wii-u-or-3ds-eshop-once-a-week-for-free-my-nintendo-platinum-points-608847.phtml"" target=""_blank"">You can also net 30 more by signing into the eShop on a Wii U or 3DS</a>.</p>
<p>My Nintendo resets <strong>are on Mondays at 12AM</strong>. Only <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> resets on Sunday mornings.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/MyNintendoPlatinumGuide2.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<h2><strong>Dig for hidden platinum</strong></h2>
<p>Occasionally, you’ll get the opportunity to find hidden Platinum Points. One of the easiest ways to identify them is with the “balloon” minigame on the home screen: where your avatar will be floating around. Normally the balloons are innocuous, but sometimes a Platinum Point coin will be stuck inside one. Pop them all to earn them. You can also find secret coins through the fishing animation: just click your avatar to potentially pull one up.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there are “hidden Miis” in certain parts of the site. The mission page sometimes hides them, <a href=""https://my.nintendo.com/news"" target=""_blank"">as well as the “news” page</a>, or individual articles within that news landing. Or, in the very top right, the little pulldown menu that appears when clicking on your avatar.</p>
<p>Don’t get too hung up on these, but if you’re fiddling around on the internet, hunting for these is an option.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/MyNintendoPlatinumRewardsGuide.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<h2><strong>Get the browser points</strong></h2>
<p>This is the simplest way to get quick points, just know that none of these are repeatable. All you have to do is follow the guides below and click on certain parts of the site and you’re good.</p>
<p>Here are all of the current browser quests, and the solutions:</p>

<h2><strong>Spam <em>Fire Emblem Heroes</em> for a treasure trove of points</strong></h2>
<p><i>Fire Emblem Heroes</i> is by far the easiest way to earn a massive amount of points quickly, and the simplest way to “bank” them. Here’s what I mean.</p>
<p>Given that there’s 5400 potential points, you could unlock 1000 right now for use for a reward, then “bank” the rest. Remember, Platinum Points expire in six months, so if you don’t want anything right now, just “save” <em>Fire Emblem Heroes</em>‘ campaign mission rewards until later. When a new reward hits, go spam more missions, get the points, and bank the rest.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/AnimalCrossingMobilePlatinumGuide.jpg?resize=640%2C422&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<h2><strong><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> is next on the My Nintendo points guide</strong></h2>
<p>Pocket Camp is your next step because it’s free, though it takes a lot more effort than spamming <em>Fire Emblem</em>.</p>
<p>For this one, you’ll need to do a bit of work. <em>Pocket Camp</em> points are accrued at a rate of 180 per week, with a weekly reset on Sunday mornings. I’ve gotten it down to where I can earn all 180 by Monday with minimal effort.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-can-net-you-180-platinum-points-a-week-for-little-effort-611053.phtml"" target=""_blank"">Follow our full guide here for more info</a>.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/SMR.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<h2><strong><em>Super Mario Run</em> is your last resort, as it costs money to buy</strong></h2>
<p>So this one is at the very bottom of the guide because it costs $10 to farm. Weekly runs will net you <b>120 platinum</b> per week (seven daily rewards of 10, with a weekly bonus of 50).</p>
<p>If you do decide to get <em>Super Mario Run</em> though, you’ll net <strong>300 platinum</strong> just for finishing the game, as well as <strong>300 more platinum</strong> for adding 10 friends. You’ll also get <strong>100 points</strong> for registering the game.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/psa-you-can-get-300-easy-my-nintendo-platinum-points-a-month-with-quick-daily-super-mario-run-sessions-610580.phtml"" target=""_blank"">Follow our full guide here</a>, which explains how to game the friend system and find sites that allow you to instantly add all 10 within a matter of hours.</p>

With My Nintendo physical rewards popping up like daisies every week, I’ve had a ton of requests from readers to explain what Platinum Points are, and how to earn them quickly. Here’s a My Nintendo points guide.
It’ll walk you through the entire process comprehensively, from starting a My Nintendo account to some of the more advanced ways of earning digital bread.

So this step is the easiest. Go make a My Nintendo account, then link your proper Nintendo account. Head to the “missions” section: this is your dashboard, where you’ll start making notes of what to do to earn Platinum Points.
Make a few quick changes to get some easy points. Link your Nintendo account, turn promotional emails on (and keep them on for recurring points), and link various social accounts (Facebook/Google/Twitter) for more points. If you’re uncomfortable with this prospect, link bogus accounts. Also don’t forget to tour the Mario 35 site and click around for more easy points.
The Cold Stone code is an odd one, but an option. You can get 100 points if you order a Mario-themed menu item, and the best way to do that without incident is online. Make a Cold Stone account, then order an item ahead of time for pickup. Make sure the “My Nintendo” promo is enabled. Some folks are reporting that it works online for all menu items as long as the code is applied (even the cheapest menu items possible, like sides), but do this at your own risk. My wife ordered a Mario shake online, and we were able to do curbside pickup: the point code was emailed to me a few hours later. Enter it here.
Another source of recurring points is the “monthly Nintendo newsletter.” Note that sometimes you’ll be required to locate a number code in the actual email, which can be redeemed for points on this page. Emails can appear sporadically or not at all, so keep an eye out for them.
When you actually use the points, you’re basically “buying” a digital code. You use that code to make the item free: then pay shipping (which is around $5). Use this opportunity to stack items together, as one purchase only incurs one flat shipping fee. In other words, you can amass points through this guide and spend them all at once.

Know the weekly resets
Every Monday, My Nintendo will allow you to click on your avatar on the homepage to earn a quick 30 Platinum Points. You can also net 30 more by signing into the eShop on a Wii U or 3DS.
My Nintendo resets are on Mondays at 12AM. Only Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp resets on Sunday mornings.

Dig for hidden platinum
Occasionally, you’ll get the opportunity to find hidden Platinum Points. One of the easiest ways to identify them is with the “balloon” minigame on the home screen: where your avatar will be floating around. Normally the balloons are innocuous, but sometimes a Platinum Point coin will be stuck inside one. Pop them all to earn them. You can also find secret coins through the fishing animation: just click your avatar to potentially pull one up.
Alternatively, there are “hidden Miis” in certain parts of the site. The mission page sometimes hides them, as well as the “news” page, or individual articles within that news landing. Or, in the very top right, the little pulldown menu that appears when clicking on your avatar.
Don’t get too hung up on these, but if you’re fiddling around on the internet, hunting for these is an option.

Get the browser points
This is the simplest way to get quick points, just know that none of these are repeatable. All you have to do is follow the guides below and click on certain parts of the site and you’re good.
Here are all of the current browser quests, and the solutions:

Pikmin 3
Astral Chain
Yoshi
Zelda
Mario Golf


Spam Fire Emblem Heroes for a treasure trove of points
Fire Emblem Heroes is by far the easiest way to earn a massive amount of points quickly, and the simplest way to “bank” them. Here’s what I mean.
Given that there’s 5400 potential points, you could unlock 1000 right now for use for a reward, then “bank” the rest. Remember, Platinum Points expire in six months, so if you don’t want anything right now, just “save” Fire Emblem Heroes‘ campaign mission rewards until later. When a new reward hits, go spam more missions, get the points, and bank the rest.
You can find a full guide for earning Heroes points here.

Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp is next on the My Nintendo points guide
Pocket Camp is your next step because it’s free, though it takes a lot more effort than spamming Fire Emblem.
For this one, you’ll need to do a bit of work. Pocket Camp points are accrued at a rate of 180 per week, with a weekly reset on Sunday mornings. I’ve gotten it down to where I can earn all 180 by Monday with minimal effort.
Follow our full guide here for more info.

Super Mario Run is your last resort, as it costs money to buy
So this one is at the very bottom of the guide because it costs $10 to farm. Weekly runs will net you 120 platinum per week (seven daily rewards of 10, with a weekly bonus of 50).
If you do decide to get Super Mario Run though, you’ll net 300 platinum just for finishing the game, as well as 300 more platinum for adding 10 friends. You’ll also get 100 points for registering the game.
Follow our full guide here, which explains how to game the friend system and find sites that allow you to instantly add all 10 within a matter of hours.

My Nintendo points guide 2022 update: do the weekly missions on your Switch
Nintendo added weekly missions in February 2022, which grant platinum points.
Here’s what you need to do:

Play something that supports online play (on a rotation)
Back up save data
Play NES/SNES (depending on the week)
Play Game Trials software (on a rotation)
Use the weekly missions application

You can find the full details here.

<h2>What a cool physical take on the mini-game</h2>
<p>Have you ever become so absorbed in a mini-game or side activity that it starts to overshadow the main game? It can be hard to pull yourself away! The most recent example I can point to is <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-cult-of-the-lamb-pc-version-town-builder-action-roguelite/"" target=""_blank""><em>Cult of the Lamb</em></a> and its snappy dice game, Knucklebones.</p>
<p>This game is compelling enough that players are sticking with it long after they’ve toppled all of the competitors and no longer need extra money earned from bets. Much like the fishing mini-game, Knucklebones is meant to flesh out the world of <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> and help you pass the time when you need a break from dungeon raiding or cult raising.</p>
<p>It’s good fun, the kind that sticks with you longer than it should — and fans want more.</p>
<p>One <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> fan created <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CultOfTheLamb/comments/wqruod/i_made_a_web_version_of_knucklebones_for_you_to/"" target=""_blank"">a browser version</a> of Knucklebones, and another, who goes by BenY-S on Reddit, whipped up their own <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CultOfTheLamb/comments/x0m4pb/i_enjoyed_knucklebones_so_much_that_i_decided_to/"" target=""_blank"">physical adaptation</a> of Knucklebones.</p>

<h2>Hands-on: It feels good to bonk pixelated monsters in this strange and evil land</h2>
<p>While sprawled-out ‘vania games have blown up in the last decade, we haven’t gotten nearly as many tributes that are <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-bloodstained-curse-of-the-moon/"" target=""_blank"">in line with the NES era</a> of <em>Castlevania</em>, so I’m always happy to see more of ’em bubble up out of the indie scene. One game that really speaks to that retro style is <em>Infernax</em>, which made <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/infernax-retro-action-game-like-nes-castlevania-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox/"" target=""_blank"">a good first impression</a> with us last year.</p>
<p>Some would call <em>Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest</em> a mess, <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/castlevania-ii-is-a-strange-and-pleasing-thing/"" target=""_blank"">others say it’s beautiful</a>, and I’ll borrow from both stances — it’s a beautiful, memorable, mystifying mess. Every time someone invokes its name, I have to fire up a YouTube upload of the soundtrack and bounce around enough to at least hear the catchy town music and iconic “Bloody Tears.”</p>
<p>Based on my recent time with a preview build of the game, <em>Infernax</em> has the look, feel, and overall trappings you’d expect — and that’s all I needed to know to be on board with it.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Infernax-town-screenshot.jpg?resize=640%2C360"" alt=""Chatting with town villagers in Infernax"" /></p>
<p>There’s a brief story setup with some cool pixel artwork, as shown at the top of this article. In short, a mad alchemist possesses a mysterious book, and our hero, Alcedor, has returned home to fight off the corruption. With evil afoot, there are skeletons to clobber, zombies to mash, floating eyeballs to squish, and meatsack bosses to outlast. The usual!</p>
<p>After jumping out of a boat and gaining control of Alcedor, I hopped back in to see if I could talk to a pixelated sailor. I could — and he shared the wisdom nugget that “You’ll drown if you fall in the water,” which is exactly the sort of reaction I was hoping for as a <em>Simon’s Quest</em> fan. Chatting up the local weirdos is part of the charm, especially in town.</p>
<p>The trailer for <em>Infernax</em> sets up a choice-based “good” or “evil” playthrough, and sure enough, I quickly ran into a villager who looked like he was about to turn into something vile. I was able to “Slay” or “Pray,” and my choice led to a mutated mini-boss fight. I’m curious how far we’ll be able to take things in the full game, but my curiosity is piqued.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Infernax-Slay-or-Pray-screenshot.jpg?resize=640%2C360"" alt=""The old moral choice to &quot;Slay&quot; or &quot;Pray&quot;"" /></p>
<p>Early on in my time with <em>Infernax</em>, I had to fight the urge to grind for currency and XP. It was <em>so tempting</em>. I couldn’t resist jumping back and forth between screens to re-kill the same group of foes. At shrines, you can save and top up your health, and also upgrade your power, health, and mana. Early-game Alcedor is more fragile than you might expect, whether we’re talking death by a thousand cuts against basic creeps or big hits in actual boss fights. Interestingly, after death, there’s a Casual and Hardcore restart.</p>
<p>The Hardcore restart takes you back to your last manual save point, and it’s meant for folks who want a more authentic, unforgiving experience (and presumably an eventual achievement payoff), while Casual sends you immediately back into the fray — it’s a do-over. After choosing the Casual restart even once, the Hardcore choice is revoked.</p>
<p>I feel like I’ll probably go through <em>Infernax</em> with Casual restarts in mind to get a feel for everything without taking things too slowly, then circle back for another playthrough with patient, methodical, not-too-risky practices in mind to make the Hardcore clear feasible. You do you, though! Even with grinding, I feel like the game will likely get pretty tough. In the opening half-hour or so, I didn’t encounter anything I’d describe as “cheap,” so we’ll see what old-school action-platformer nastiness might be in store later.</p>
<p>Outside of bosses, including one that was part of an optional backtrack-at-night quest, the starter enemies were easy to take out so long as I wasn’t overwhelmed by pesky group-ups. Further into the preview build, one particular skeleton proved to be trickier in terms of its protected weak point and alternating movements, almost in a <em>Zelda II</em> sort of way, which I appreciated. (Nothing a lightning spell couldn’t help me handle; on a second run-through, I picked up a healing spell instead. Both of them felt powerful.)</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Infernax-skeleton-knight-screenshot.jpg?resize=640%2C360"" alt=""Infernax has slight Zelda II vibes"" /></p>
<p>I’m not sure if there are any plans to release this slice of the game to the public as a demo, even just as a limited-time offering in, say, a Steam Fest, but I think it would sell people on <em>Infernax</em>. This brief run through a <em>Castlevania</em>-inspired playground made me realize how much I miss the series’ original vibe, even now in 2022. It feels just fresh enough.</p>
<p>Unlike the screwball <em>Simon’s Quest</em>, I’m pretty sure <em>Infernax</em> will be palatable to a wider audience. As much as I hope there are finicky secrets to figure out, I’m totally fine with (what appears to be) a less obtuse progression path. Enough breathing room for players to explore and make discoveries without leading them so astray that a guide feels mandatory — that’s my ideal balance. It’s got a fun darkly humorous tone to it, too.</p>

<p>I’ve scratched the surface of this game — the preview build ended quickly enough that I was compelled to play it over again without a second thought — but I can say that it’s on the right track. If you like old-school <em>Castlevania</em>, and you’re open to some more modern touches, chances are, you’ll dig this game. You made it this far into the article, after all.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.infernax.com/"" target=""_blank"">Berzerk Studio</a> and <a href=""https://www.thearcadecrew.com/"" target=""_blank"">The Arcade Crew</a> plan to release <em>Infernax</em> for PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on February 14, 2022.</p>

Hands-on: It feels good to bonk pixelated monsters in this strange and evil land
While sprawled-out ‘vania games have blown up in the last decade, we haven’t gotten nearly as many tributes that are in line with the NES era of Castlevania, so I’m always happy to see more of ’em bubble up out of the indie scene. One game that really speaks to that retro style is Infernax, which made a good first impression with us last year.
Some would call Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest a mess, others say it’s beautiful, and I’ll borrow from both stances — it’s a beautiful, memorable, mystifying mess. Every time someone invokes its name, I have to fire up a YouTube upload of the soundtrack and bounce around enough to at least hear the catchy town music and iconic “Bloody Tears.”
Based on my recent time with a preview build of the game, Infernax has the look, feel, and overall trappings you’d expect — and that’s all I needed to know to be on board with it.

There’s a brief story setup with some cool pixel artwork, as shown at the top of this article. In short, a mad alchemist possesses a mysterious book, and our hero, Alcedor, has returned home to fight off the corruption. With evil afoot, there are skeletons to clobber, zombies to mash, floating eyeballs to squish, and meatsack bosses to outlast. The usual!
After jumping out of a boat and gaining control of Alcedor, I hopped back in to see if I could talk to a pixelated sailor. I could — and he shared the wisdom nugget that “You’ll drown if you fall in the water,” which is exactly the sort of reaction I was hoping for as a Simon’s Quest fan. Chatting up the local weirdos is part of the charm, especially in town.
The trailer for Infernax sets up a choice-based “good” or “evil” playthrough, and sure enough, I quickly ran into a villager who looked like he was about to turn into something vile. I was able to “Slay” or “Pray,” and my choice led to a mutated mini-boss fight. I’m curious how far we’ll be able to take things in the full game, but my curiosity is piqued.

Early on in my time with Infernax, I had to fight the urge to grind for currency and XP. It was so tempting. I couldn’t resist jumping back and forth between screens to re-kill the same group of foes. At shrines, you can save and top up your health, and also upgrade your power, health, and mana. Early-game Alcedor is more fragile than you might expect, whether we’re talking death by a thousand cuts against basic creeps or big hits in actual boss fights. Interestingly, after death, there’s a Casual and Hardcore restart.
The Hardcore restart takes you back to your last manual save point, and it’s meant for folks who want a more authentic, unforgiving experience (and presumably an eventual achievement payoff), while Casual sends you immediately back into the fray — it’s a do-over. After choosing the Casual restart even once, the Hardcore choice is revoked.
I feel like I’ll probably go through Infernax with Casual restarts in mind to get a feel for everything without taking things too slowly, then circle back for another playthrough with patient, methodical, not-too-risky practices in mind to make the Hardcore clear feasible. You do you, though! Even with grinding, I feel like the game will likely get pretty tough. In the opening half-hour or so, I didn’t encounter anything I’d describe as “cheap,” so we’ll see what old-school action-platformer nastiness might be in store later.
Outside of bosses, including one that was part of an optional backtrack-at-night quest, the starter enemies were easy to take out so long as I wasn’t overwhelmed by pesky group-ups. Further into the preview build, one particular skeleton proved to be trickier in terms of its protected weak point and alternating movements, almost in a Zelda II sort of way, which I appreciated. (Nothing a lightning spell couldn’t help me handle; on a second run-through, I picked up a healing spell instead. Both of them felt powerful.)

I’m not sure if there are any plans to release this slice of the game to the public as a demo, even just as a limited-time offering in, say, a Steam Fest, but I think it would sell people on Infernax. This brief run through a Castlevania-inspired playground made me realize how much I miss the series’ original vibe, even now in 2022. It feels just fresh enough.
Unlike the screwball Simon’s Quest, I’m pretty sure Infernax will be palatable to a wider audience. As much as I hope there are finicky secrets to figure out, I’m totally fine with (what appears to be) a less obtuse progression path. Enough breathing room for players to explore and make discoveries without leading them so astray that a guide feels mandatory — that’s my ideal balance. It’s got a fun darkly humorous tone to it, too.

I’ve scratched the surface of this game — the preview build ended quickly enough that I was compelled to play it over again without a second thought — but I can say that it’s on the right track. If you like old-school Castlevania, and you’re open to some more modern touches, chances are, you’ll dig this game. You made it this far into the article, after all.
Berzerk Studio and The Arcade Crew plan to release Infernax for PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on February 14, 2022.

<h2>Swap a slick suit for a spacesuit</h2>
<p><em>Crysis 4</em> might still be a long, long way from touching down, but today brings some interesting news from deep within the corridors of Crytek.

<p>Engström has more than proved their worth in the field of game design, having created many of <em>Hitman</em>‘s memorable and varied sandbox assassination locales. Prior to this, Engström also worked on level design for Ubisoft hits<em> Assassin’s Creed: Revelations</em> and <em>Far Cry 3</em>, so they are well versed in creating immersive and atmospheric worlds… and then filling them with things to kill. It will be disappointing to see Engström duck out, as they would have been very welcome on set for<em><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/will-iois-project-007-allow-us-to-create-our-own-custom-bond/"" target=""_blank""> Project 007</a>,</em> but I’m sure the talented team at IO will continue their fine work.</p>

<p>First up, everyone waited around in a lobby 30 minutes before: for folks who didn’t want to join last minute and get smacked in the face with an error. As a warm-up of sorts, cube monsters started pouring into the main cordoned off zone near the middle of the map, as players fended them off.</p>

<p>Once the clock struck 4PM ET, the Chapter 2 <em>Fortnite</em> event was underway, and the Cube Queen got pissed, and sent bigger and badder creatures into the collective last stand of our party.</p>
<p>While clearly scripted, the assault was pretty fun to fend off. The Queen sent UFOs to bombard the shield protecting the area and the gigantic hulking <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://fortnite.fandom.com/wiki/Caretaker"">Caretakers</a>, which took a lot of ammo to take down.

		<h2>Rumble Roses</h2>
<p>Something<em> very</em> special from the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster takes time out from its recent Namco obsession to deliver not only a Tecmo title, but a fun, silly, and particularly obscure one at that — Available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch its forgotten fighter <em>Angel Eyes!</em></p>
<p>Released to Japanese arcades in 1996, <em>Angel Eyes</em> — or to give it its full title<em> Tōkidenshō Angel Eyes</em> — is a super cult 2D fighter that was renowned for sporting an All Anime Gal cast of scrappers. A selection of fun character tropes, including a school girl, a volleyball player, a kunoichi, an arrogant “ojou” woman, and a young girl with a giant teddy bear (<a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dnf-duel-enchantress-trailer-nexon-fighting-games-arcsys/"" target=""_blank"">predating Enchantress by several decades</a>), fight it out in cute ‘n’ colorful action, set against the backdrop of some equally strange locations, such as a fun fair, and a medieval castle!</p>
<p>Check out the cute ‘n’ crazy carnage in the video below, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR2L0bPxY_M"" target=""_blank"">courtesy of YouTuber Colmarr.</a></p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/hR2L0bPxY_M?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Angel Eyes</em>, despite its seeming irrelevance, had some surprisingly prescient ideas.

Something very special from the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster takes time out from its recent Namco obsession to deliver not only a Tecmo title, but a fun, silly, and particularly obscure one at that — Available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch its forgotten fighter Angel Eyes!
Released to Japanese arcades in 1996, Angel Eyes — or to give it its full title Tōkidenshō Angel Eyes — is a super cult 2D fighter that was renowned for sporting an All Anime Gal cast of scrappers. A selection of fun character tropes, including a school girl, a volleyball player, a kunoichi, an arrogant “ojou” woman, and a young girl with a giant teddy bear (predating Enchantress by several decades), fight it out in cute ‘n’ colorful action, set against the backdrop of some equally strange locations, such as a fun fair, and a medieval castle!
Check out the cute ‘n’ crazy carnage in the video below, courtesy of YouTuber Colmarr.

Angel Eyes, despite its seeming irrelevance, had some surprisingly prescient ideas. Not only is it one of the first-ever “all women” fighting games, but it is also one of the first 2D fighters to feature a heavy slant on juggles and air combos. Perhaps its funniest and most bizarre mechanic, however, is reserved for the so-called “reverse combo correction” system, which actually increases damage the longer a combo goes on — rather than scales it back. And thus, players with one or two fairly solid combos can find themselves taking down their opponents in a manner of seconds.
You thought Street Fighter V was “three mistakes to death”? Try “one mistake to death”!

There’s something about Microids’ exact phrasing – “Four new Smurfs video game adaptations will be released over the next five years!” – that tickled us this morning in the Destructoid staff chat.

<p>One of the more intriguing titles on my (and many others) watchlist is Round8 Studio’s <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/lies-of-p-alpha-gameplay-trailer/"" target=""_blank""><em>Lies of P</em></a> — this gothic retelling of the famous tale of Pinocchio is currently in development for PC and console platforms, and promises a dark-yet-faithful take on the story of the puppet child and his endeavor to become human.</p>
<p>Publisher Neowiz has taken the bold step of releasing a huge gameplay showcase, which features <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjGo-l34m18"" target=""_blank"">no less than 40+ minutes</a> of <em>Lies of P</em> in action. The video spotlights the opulent but miserable architecture, grim splendor, and frightening oppression of the city of Krat, the backdrop to our young hero’s quest. Pinocchio must battle violent automatons, engage with what remains of the local community, and harness the power of falsehoods in order to come face to face with their ultimate destiny with humanity.</p>

<p>As you can see from these two videos, <em>Lies of P</em> has chosen to embed itself within the<em> Soulslike</em> genre, with deliberately paced gameplay and challenging, rhythmic combat. Pinnochio has access to a wide array of tools and weaponry with which to defend himself and, being a doll, is capable of replacing and upgrading components of his own body to better stand up to the challenges that lie ahead of him.</p>
<p>And, speaking of lies, Pinnochio must also weaponize truth and dishonesty in order to reach his fate. During his journey, Pinocchio’s moral fiber will be repeatedly tested, with his ability to speak both truthfully and untruthfully reflected in the outcome of his tale, changing the fates of himself and those around him. How effective this mechanic plays out in the final game remains to be seen, but I can’t be but hugely intrigued by almost every element of<em> Lies of P</em>, from its characters and world to its grim adaptation of a classic fable, married to the uncompromising <em>Soulslike</em> genre.</p>

<p>“When we showed you the [<em>Dead Space</em> remake] Plasma Cutter and Pulse Rifle not everyone was sold on it, and there were a handful of criticisms that felt they could still be better,” <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadSpace/comments/u2wprg/dead_space_remake_update_from_motive_audio/i4li6yf/"" target=""_blank"">explained</a> Motive. “We believe that the feedback given was definitely valid and reading the comments on what was highlighted, we made a few modifications that we think improve it!” These live streams and open lines of communication are appreciated.</p>

<p>This before-and-after clip speaks for itself, and I think they’re on the right track with these weapons. That said, I’m a Plasma Cutter man for life, so I’ll be skipping the Pulse Rifle.</p>

<p>Even though I told myself I wouldn’t obsess too much over the minutia, well, here we are!

Just like in the 2008 original, I want to have to physically catch my breath.</p>
<p>It’d be nice to just wake up in early 2023 and be completely surprised by the <em>Dead Space</em> remake, but I know myself too well — I can’t resist peeking at it all year long.

While most of the posts usually consist of players posting bugs or how they’ve decorated their farms, a series of new memes have surfaced, which in turn has spawned a series of mods. The best part is that the joke isn’t even about anything in the actual core game itself, but instead in the introduction cutscene that plays when a player boots up a new save file. That’s right — it’s a bunch of<em> </em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/uazj0d/i_feel_like_ive_helped_kick_off_a_dying_grandpa/"">grandpa mods</a>.</p>
<p>The original scene starts with the player’s grandpa on his death bed (morbid, I know) as the game truly begins when the player inherits their grandfather’s farm and moves to Pelican Town. While the rest of the sequence shows the player character quitting their job and getting on the bus out to the country, it’s this first part that players have chosen to fixate on. You see, grandpa’s bed is looking a little rickety — kind of like the crappiest IKEA bed you can find, in fact, with just four skinny pieces of wood to hold it up. It looks like it’s ready to collapse at any second.</p>

<p>Players thought this was pretty funny, and so they took the intro and ran with it by modding the opening scene of the game with their own interpretations.</p>
<p>One mod makes the already pretty crappy bed only <a href=""https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11737"" target=""_blank"">slightly worse</a>, while others depict the <a href=""https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11789"" target=""_blank"">already-dead grandpa</a> dead on the floor with flies buzzing around him. You can even mod him in the classic <a href=""https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11776"" target=""_blank""><em>Family Guy</em> death pose</a>, if you so wish. The most recent installment makes it look like he’s <a href=""https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11798"" target=""_blank"">wet the bed</a>. Someone even went to the trouble of adding a NSFW, uh, <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewMemes/comments/u96b4z/grandpa_noooooo/i5rh810/"" target=""_blank"">happy version</a> of grandpa’s death.</p>
<p>These mods are pretty silly, but I do have to admit that they play into the game’s tone in a fun way. <em>Stardew Valley</em>‘s opening with grandpa may make the game look all sweet and innocent from the start, but under the surface, it’s full of darker hidden content, like turning your unwanted children into doves, for example. I have to hand it to the <em>Stardew</em> Reddit community for their creativity, because these certainly made me chuckle.</p>

In one respect, to “shut the fuck up and just play games” is our way of getting past the petty console warring and PC elitist mentality to focus on what really matters — the games themselves. More broadly, though, it’s about its about discussing and celebrating games. It is about having a good time, enjoying each others’ company and being excellent.</p>
<p>We’re also all about community. Destructoid and the rest of the Enthusiast Gaming family pride ourselves of uniting gamers from all around the world.  Here’s a simple guide to finding your way around our sites and also how to keep your account in good standing.  It’s pretty simple: Don’t astroturf drama, don’t spam or solicit, and generally speaking, just don’t be a dick.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/179618-364616-267903stfuajpgjpg-noscale.jpg?resize=620%2C350"" alt=""STFUAJPG"" /></p>
<p>Here’s how to make the most of our community:</p>
<p>– <strong><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/"">The Front Page</a></strong> – This is where the news, previews, reviews, staff editorials and <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/?t=Promoted+stories&amp;start=0"">promoted community blogs</a> appear. It is also a place where we may also try to <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/darren-thought-he-had-one-skill-so-we-all-had-to-prove-him-wrong-347515.phtml"">shove beer cans in our mouths</a> and <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/amiibo-as-butt-plugs-ranked-331236.phtml"">rate amiibo as buttplugs</a> if you’re into that sort of thing. Games blogging is indeed serious business 24/7 here at Dtoid.</p>
<p>– <strong><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/blogs/?qp=1"">Quickposts</a></strong> – Quickposts are like Dtoid’s own personal community Twitter, but with 115 more characters and fewer randos. It is for posting status updates, insights, jokes or waifus/husbandos and whatever.</p>
<p>– <strong><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/blogs/?qp=0"">The Community Blogs</a></strong> – Beyond mere comments, we also provide a space where our community can post blogs of their own. This could be used to write reviews of games, commentary, developer blogs*, counterpoints, funny listicles and more. If our community managers find your blog to be awesome, you could find your blog whisked away to the front page where we make your ass famous!</p>
<p><em>(*Note – To separate the wheat from the chaff, developer blogs that are posted with the genuine intent of interacting regularly with the Dtoid community are the only kind we’ll accept. Anything that reads like an ad will deleted at the discretion of our community team.

<p>– <strong>Discord</strong> – We have two Discord channels, a wholly community-run <strong><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://discordapp.com/invite/3J3kcQd"">Communitoid Discord</a></strong> and <strong>EGLX Discord</strong>, for attendees of our annual video game convention.</p>

<p><em><strong>Moderation — Or what happens when you forget how to STFUAJPG</strong></em></p>
<p>Naturally, internet debates will happen and that’s cool. Opinions are fine and criticism is more than welcome. That’s communication at work, but to keep everyone sane here is how to avoid incurring the wrath of our dutiful moderators and community management ninjas, fairies and catbearded men:</p>
<p>It’s actually quite simple — <i> be excellent to each other.</i></p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Excellent-noscale.jpg?resize=640%2C274"" alt=""Be Excellent"" /></p>
<p>Our moderators and community managers use that one simple line as a guiding philosophy to what is okay and what isn’t on our sites whether it is comments, quickposts or blogs.</p>
<p>If you need deeper clarification for what this means, you can find further details below, but know these guidelines are not to be interpreted verbatim by the user and our mods will use these guidelines as they see applicable to a given situation. If you’re unsure if something might get you in trouble, feel free to contact us at <a target=""_blank"" href=""mailto:community@destructoid.com"">community@destructoid.com</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s how to be excellent and avoid comment deletions or getting banned:</p>
<p>– <strong>No hate speech or flaming</strong>. This includes racist, sexist, gendered, ableist, ageist, homophobic and transphobic slurs and language of any sort. Death threats and telling people to die is also a no-no.</p>
<p>Think you can dump on someone of a particular faith? <em>Bzzzzt</em>, wrong. Want to dispense medical advice without a license? Not happening here.</p>
<p>We also think rape jokes and the people who tell them <strong>suck</strong>. Don’t go there. In fact, it’s best to avoid punching down altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Harassment</strong>, <strong>dogpiling and gaslighting will not be tolerated</strong> toward our community members or staff. Additionally,  Destructoid will not be a forum for doxxing or obsessive, gossipy types that sift through the private lives of others be it staff, community members or even people off-site in the name of Internet “justice.”</p>
<p>Basically, if you think the internet is your personal playground in which you can push the least of us out because you can’t share a hobby, we will show you the door. Using the Internet to vent is one thing, but if you’re here to be perpetually miserable to others or neg on every game discussed, you won’t be here long.</p>
<p>Remember: That handle and avatar on the internet is a real human being like you with a life, problems, favorite game genres, foods and opinions that are more varied than a pack of Skittles. If you’re not willing to taste the rainbow and get along with it, the mighty banhammer of Thor will fall upon ye for She is righteous and just.</p>

<p>– <em><strong>Keep on-topic in site reviews</strong></em>. Look, we get it, you’re excited about a new release or curious to know more about it. That’s fine, but <em>being pedantic about the score a game is given or insinuating a reviewer didn’t review the game properly isn’t</em>.</p>
<p>A lot goes into doing a review, publishers may place embargoes and give limited windows within which to review games and these days games can launch before we’re even allowed to review them. Sometimes releases can even come out of nowhere or personal schedules may change in response to a release. Reviews are a process that take lots of time and energy. The Destructoid staff endeavors to get reviews out in as timely a fashion as possible.</p>
<p>So respect the writer of the review and the Destructoid community by keeping things focused and allowing people to ask their questions so the reviewer can respond to them without getting dragged off-topic.</p>
<p>Having a good time, making jokes and sharing fair criticisms is fine, but taking a lower score as a personal slight against you and a cherished aggregate or demanding a game be dragged over the coals because you don’t like it just makes you look like a miserable child and won’t be seen as acceptable behavior.</p>
<p>– <strong>Do not impersonate staff</strong> members or portray yourself as one when you are not and don’t make “official” Destructoid events without approval from staff first.</p>
<p>Our community has unofficial play groups, chat rooms, podcasts and more, but making them official without approval from staff means we can get connected to problems and drama we don’t cause. That’s no fun for anybody. We appreciate your enthusiasm and welcome increased participation, but be sensible and label unofficial joints as such.</p>
<p>–<strong> Every interpretation of spamming is prohibited. </strong>This means unauthorized advertisements, links to any kind of online gambling, game currency sellers, follower sellers, self-promotion of mobile games, YouTube channels, or unsanctioned crowdfunding, Steam Greenlight campaigns and charity efforts** are not to be posted in comments, blogs or quickposts. If they are found they will be deleted without notice. We don’t care if you’re a prince promising us a life of wealth, comfort and marriage if we help you get a plane ticket to New York.</p>
<p>Accounts posting spam will be cast into the nearest Oblivion gate where the Daedra can feast on your flesh and soul. Additionally, repeat offenders will get blacklisted.</p>

<p><em>(** Note: If you have a fundraiser for a legitimately good cause, please email community@destructoid.com to get it whitelisted ahead of time. Posting it without notice will result in an account deletion otherwise.)</em></p>
<p>– We may play host to NSFW or spoiler-ish content at times, but only with proper advance warning and context. We report on games and content or merchandise related to them, after all, and this site is meant for adults</p>
<p>That said, we suggest you maintain similar warnings and context in your quickposts and blogs if you are going to post such content. Keep in mind we have users that may be browsing from work or college and not every users settings are the same as your own</p>
<p>Do not post pornographic images or gory JPEGs, GIFs or Youtube links in front page Disqus comments, ever, though. That’s instaban stuff. Maliciously posting pornographic, gory content or story spoilers when other users have told you to stop will be grounds for a ban.</p>
<p>– Don’t post about or link to ways to pirate games or jailbreak consoles or devices. Also, don’t brag about stealing from content creators. Additionally, do not use other people’s work (written, video, drawn or a game – copyrighted or otherwise) and present it as your own. So tacky. Much plagiarism. Wow.</p>
<p>– Don’t post scans from magazines and if you’re in a closed beta and have signed a non-disclosure agreement, be awesome and smart by honoring it. Users posting details and images under NDA could get our nuts/ovaries totally roasted, so please don’t post content under NDA.</p>
<p>– And finally, once again, harassment of users and staff will not be tolerated. Whether it is the comment section, quickposts, the forums, Discord or Twitch our terms of service are consistent across the board. Your tenure as a user and your possible contributions to the community may very well be great and appreciated, but don’t mistake that for brownie points you can spend harassing others.</p>
<p>We know the difference between the people who just had one bad moment and those here to consistently act in bad faith. Bad faith users will see bans.</p>

Our Terms of Service is simple: Be excellent to each other.
Have you ever heard one of us say STFUAJPG?  It’s the Destructoid motto; our guiding philosophy and rallying cry. In one respect, to “shut the fuck up and just play games” is our way of getting past the petty console warring and PC elitist mentality to focus on what really matters — the games themselves. More broadly, though, it’s about its about discussing and celebrating games. It is about having a good time, enjoying each others’ company and being excellent.
We’re also all about community. Destructoid and the rest of the Enthusiast Gaming family pride ourselves of uniting gamers from all around the world.  Here’s a simple guide to finding your way around our sites and also how to keep your account in good standing.  It’s pretty simple: Don’t astroturf drama, don’t spam or solicit, and generally speaking, just don’t be a dick.

Here’s how to make the most of our community:
– The Front Page – This is where the news, previews, reviews, staff editorials and promoted community blogs appear. It is also a place where we may also try to shove beer cans in our mouths and rate amiibo as buttplugs if you’re into that sort of thing. Games blogging is indeed serious business 24/7 here at Dtoid.
– Quickposts – Quickposts are like Dtoid’s own personal community Twitter, but with 115 more characters and fewer randos. It is for posting status updates, insights, jokes or waifus/husbandos and whatever.
– The Community Blogs – Beyond mere comments, we also provide a space where our community can post blogs of their own. This could be used to write reviews of games, commentary, developer blogs*, counterpoints, funny listicles and more. If our community managers find your blog to be awesome, you could find your blog whisked away to the front page where we make your ass famous!
(*Note – To separate the wheat from the chaff, developer blogs that are posted with the genuine intent of interacting regularly with the Dtoid community are the only kind we’ll accept. Anything that reads like an ad will deleted at the discretion of our community team. Similarly, promoting your own YouTube channels without any investment in our community will be treated as unauthorized advertisement.)
– Discord – We have two Discord channels, a wholly community-run Communitoid Discord and EGLX Discord, for attendees of our annual video game convention.

Moderation — Or what happens when you forget how to STFUAJPG
Naturally, internet debates will happen and that’s cool. Opinions are fine and criticism is more than welcome. That’s communication at work, but to keep everyone sane here is how to avoid incurring the wrath of our dutiful moderators and community management ninjas, fairies and catbearded men:

<h2>The Activision Blizzard CEO promises “swift action” to ensure a safe environment</h2>
<p>Last night, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick sent a letter to all company employees, addressing its response to last week’s lawsuit filing. In it, the CEO calls the initial responses “tone deaf” and outlines a few steps the company is immediately taking.</p>
<p>“It is imperative that we acknowledge all perspectives and experiences and respect the feelings of those who have been mistreated in any way,” said Kotick <a href=""https://investor.activision.com/node/34326/pdf"" target=""_blank"">in the letter</a>. “I am sorry that we did not provide the right empathy and understanding.”</p>
<p>The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, or DFEH, <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-toxic-workplace-allegations-california/"" target=""_blank"">filed a lawsuit last week</a> following a two-year investigation into Activision Blizzard’s culture, alleging discrimination and sexual harassment. Activision Blizzard’s initial response claimed that the lawsuit contained “distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard’s past.”</p>
<p>The response from Activision Blizzard employees has been to <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/activision-blizzard-employees-sign-letter-report-news/"" target=""_blank"">sign a letter decrying the leadership’s response</a> as “abhorrent and insulting,” and to <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/activision-blizzard-walkout-planned-lawsuit-news/"" target=""_blank"">plan a walkout</a> being held today, July 28, both online and at the Blizzard campus in Irvine. Their demands include removing mandatory arbitration clauses, improving hiring, recruiting, and promotion practices, and to generally improve conditions for employees at the company, “especially women, and in particular women of color and transgender women, nonbinary people, and other marginalized groups.”</p>

The Activision Blizzard CEO promises “swift action” to ensure a safe environment
Last night, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick sent a letter to all company employees, addressing its response to last week’s lawsuit filing. In it, the CEO calls the initial responses “tone deaf” and outlines a few steps the company is immediately taking.
“It is imperative that we acknowledge all perspectives and experiences and respect the feelings of those who have been mistreated in any way,” said Kotick in the letter. “I am sorry that we did not provide the right empathy and understanding.”
The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, or DFEH, filed a lawsuit last week following a two-year investigation into Activision Blizzard’s culture, alleging discrimination and sexual harassment. Activision Blizzard’s initial response claimed that the lawsuit contained “distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard’s past.”
The response from Activision Blizzard employees has been to sign a letter decrying the leadership’s response as “abhorrent and insulting,” and to plan a walkout being held today, July 28, both online and at the Blizzard campus in Irvine. Their demands include removing mandatory arbitration clauses, improving hiring, recruiting, and promotion practices, and to generally improve conditions for employees at the company, “especially women, and in particular women of color and transgender women, nonbinary people, and other marginalized groups.”
In Kotick’s letter to the staff, the Activision Blizzard CEO says the company will be taking “swift action” to ensure a safe environment, including a review of policies and procedures from law firm WilmerHale, continued investigation into claims, and more resources put into diverse hiring practices.
In-game content is also being adjusted in response to input from employee and player communities, as noted by the World of Warcraft team yesterday. Wowhead has been cataloging the changes, which include the removal of several references to former Senior Creative Director Alex Afrasiabi.
Activision Blizzard employees plan to walk out today, as participants and supporters are boosting the #ActiBlizzWalkout hashtag. Organizers have asked supporters to use the tag, as well as donate to various charities, including Black Girls Code, Futures Without Violence, Girls Who Code, RAINN, Women in Animation, and Women in Games International.
[Update: The organizers of today’s walkout have released a response to Kotick’s letter, highlighting several areas the CEO did not address, including:

The end of forced arbitration for all employees.
Worker participation in oversight of hiring and promotion policies.
The need for greater pay transparency to ensure equality.
Employee selection of a third party to audit HR and other company processes.

“We expect a prompt response and a commitment to action from leadership on the points enumerated above, and look forward to maintaining a constructive dialogue on how to build a better Activision Blizzard for all employees,” said the organizers (emphasis theirs).

Ubisoft has seemingly delisted its recent YouTube video announcing the implementation of NFT technology within terrible shooter Ghost Recon Breakpoint. The trailer spotlights the “Ubisoft Quartz” beta — the publisher’s first foray in blockchain gaming — which will kick off with limited-edition cosmetics (or “Digits”) being added for purchase and resale within Ghost Recon Breakpoint and, presumably, future Ubisoft titles.
This morning, however, the YouTube trailer is set as “unlisted” by its uploader, following what appears to be an overwhelming torrent of negative feedback. While the video-sharing platform recently removed the ability to view “dislikes” from its default player, The Gamer is reporting that (browser extension) “Return YouTube Dislike” reveals a “downvote” count of over 16,000 clicks, with upvotes ranging around the 850 mark.

<p>It’s been a long, long, <em>long</em> time coming, but fight fans finally have a release date for QuByte Interactive’s long-awaited two-hander <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/breakers-collection-live-stream-crossplay-replays-rollback-qubyte/"" target=""_blank""><em>Breakers Collection</em></a> — The compendium of old-school-cool fighting titles will finally launch January 12 on PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.</p>
<p><em>Breakers Collection</em> consists of two cult fighting titles from the halcyon days of the genre’s first glory period. Initially developed by Visco Corporation, both <em>Breakers</em> (1996) and its revamped edition, <em>Breakers’ Revenge</em> (1998) have been spruced up with a fab collection of <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/breakers-collection-live-stream-crossplay-replays-rollback-qubyte/"" target=""_blank"">modern-day features</a>. These include rollback netcode, crossplay functionality, a Team Battle mode, a deep training mode, player profiles, new character color options, and a fantastic Interactive Replay mode, which gives players the opportunity to relive their losses and experiment to find out what alternate paths could have been taken.</p>

		<h2>The strategy RPG is making its way to Nintendo’s portable console</h2>
<p>Tactics fans keep getting more games, and that now includes a surprising port from Aksys Games. <em>Record of Agarest War </em>is making its way to Nintendo Switch in March 2023.</p>
<p>This strategy RPG originally released in 2007 in Japan, eventually making a western debut on the PlayStation 3 in 2009. It’s since been ported to many other platforms and now, years and years later, it pops up again on Nintendo Switch.</p>

<h2>Generations of war</h2>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with <em>Record of Agarest War</em>, it’s a strategy RPG with a dating twist. Developed as a collaboration between Compile Heart, Red Entertainment, and Idea Factory, you play as several different protagonists embroiled in conflict.</p>
<p>But the way you navigate through the plot is, well, through generations. As the first protagonist, you can romance and marry one of several party members. Then, your child goes on to be protagonist number 2. This plays out across several generations, with the chosen bride affecting the next hero’s stats and aspects of their appearance.</p>
<p>So yes, fans of <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-fire-emblem-awakening/"" target=""_blank""><em>Fire Emblem: Awakening</em></a>‘s child-unit min-maxing might want to take note. This is a bit of a surprise, as <em>Agarest War </em>has been a more niche series in the pantheon of SRPG discussion.

<h2>Master of puppets</h2>
<p>When <em>Lies of P </em>was first announced, I was awestruck by its concept. An action RPG <em>Souls</em>-like set in a dark Victorian world, where you play as essentially Pinocchio with weapons. It sounds wild! Now, after <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzE4WBKs98o"" target=""_blank"">seeing some gameplay</a>, <em>Lies of P </em>has left me with some weird lingering questions.</p>
<p>Developer Round8 Studio showed off some alpha gameplay of <em>Lies of P </em>today, setting both the tone of the world and displaying some combat. It’s got a real good look to it, with a ruined city and dark alleyways, softly lit by nearby lamps.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/QzE4WBKs98o?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>But I really have to ask: what was up with that “APAB” sign? Its similarity to real-world acronyms is the sort of sudden fourth-wall breaking moment that reminds me of <em>Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</em>‘s marketing campaign, and <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/deus-ex-goes-from-mechanical-apartheid-to-aug-lives-matter/"" target=""_blank"">not in a good way</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a jarring aside for a game that doesn’t really need any help. The concept is already <em>Pinocchio </em>meets <em>Souls</em>. That’s already got my attention. Pulling in a real-world phrase, with its own connotations and meaning, rarely grafts well onto fiction.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LiesofP_APAB_110821.jpg?resize=640%2C369"" alt /></p>
<p>Anyways, the rest of the trailer looks pretty solid. <em>Lies of P </em>looks to have some fast, hectic combat, and your puppet protagonist can wield different weapons. Plus, there are some cool-looking animations where Pinocchio kind of revs up his sword on his arm, and it looks rad.</p>
<p>So it’s a bit of a bummer that an otherwise neat trailer has such an odd, lingering aftertaste. Granted, this is all early on in development, but now I’m just wondering what the general shape of <em>Lies of P </em>is going to be, and what it’s going to be going for once it launches.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Jhfofq-ehw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.

For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.

<h2>From zero to no more hero</h2>
<p>“If you identify with this loser, you have problems.”</p>
<p>That’s what Game Informer said about Travis Touchdown, the star of the <em>No More Heroes</em> series, <a href=""https://twitter.com/JZBeast/status/1425248489706033153"" target=""_blank"">in a list of “Top Ten Dorks of 2008.”</a> Not the highest of praise, but in a way, they had a point. As it turns out, a lot of people who love games also happen to suffer from social anxiety, identity confusion, a history of trauma, and other problems. Like anyone, they want to see themselves represented in the media they enjoy, and when it comes to mass-market gaming, it can be tough to find honest representation. That’s still true now, and it was even more true 13 years ago.</p>
<p>In an industry striving for AAA, 10/10 perfection, Travis busted in screaming “I’m a big, broken idiot!”, and we loved him for it. Seeing him ridiculed by the establishment could be frustrating, but in the end, it only added to his time-tested, underdog charm. With three sequels, a Mii costume in <em>Smash Bros.</em>, and even a <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13rhrr86_CI"">jazz album (!)</a> under his belt, Travis has proven that losers like him can win. Not bad for an old dork from 2008.</p>
<p>With its third, and maybe final numbered game on the horizon, <em>No More Heroes</em> curiosity is at an all-time high, and what better way to both satisfy that curiosity and, er, “stoke” it than with a video game blog! If you’ve always wanted to know more about the franchise, or if you’re just looking to refresh your memory on Travis’ history, <strong>here’s a spoiler-free</strong>, sometimes cryptic, recap of the <em>No More Heroes</em> story so far.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZDhGYN2-iQA?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<h3><em><strong>No More Heroes </strong></em></h3>
<p>Travis kicks off his first story with a hyper-active monologue about how he bought a beam katana online and plans to use it to become a great assassin. From the start, the game rides the line between parody and tribute. Is it making fun of “cool nerds and the games they love,” or is it glorifying them? Can it do both at the same time? The tension in that question buzzes below the surface for the entirety of <em>No More Heroes</em>‘ run-time.</p>
<p>Travis is a powerful warrior who takes on hordes of blood-thirsty rivals all at once. He’s the textbook definition of a “cool, badass action hero.” The way he’s forced to do the “jerk off” motion with his sword in front of everyone in order to recharge it, leaving him vulnerable to both physical and emotional attacks at the same time? That’s less “badass” and more “<a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/suda51-announces-killer7-for-steam-at-momocon-2018/"" target=""_blank"">jackass</a>,” and that split down the middle between stud and dud doesn’t end there. He gets two kinds of phone calls every day: invitations to an underground society of assassins, and voicemails from the local video store listing all the pornos he owes late fees on. He splits his time between menial work and murdering murderers.</p>
<p>For a lot of us, Travis is how we look in a funhouse mirror — ridiculously exaggerated, volatile, but still a reflection of reality. He’s a guy we can both laugh at and laugh with, look down on him with one eye, look up to with the other.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/E_4-2q4AR1c?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>Isolation is the unifying factor in Travis’ fractured life. He has a cat, who he silently pets, and a minor acquaintance named Bishop, but other than that, he’s going it alone. Over the course of the game, we come to find that there are reasons for that. Travis didn’t enter the world of competitive killing just for shits and giggles. As his battles against the bosses become increasingly strange, it becomes clearer that <em>No More Heroes</em> isn’t just another dumb action-comedy. It’s about Travis’ love/hate relationship with violence, and with himself. He’s trapped by it, struggling to find the exit, and in the end, it seems never-ending. There’s joy and pain in that, and more than anything, there’s truth.</p>
<p>For many,<em> No More Heroes</em> was their gateway into this deeper world of symbolism-heavy “auteur gaming.” It sold itself with novelty and brutality, but that was just to get you in the door. Once it gets its hooks in you, it takes you to places you may not have otherwise chosen to go. A cutscene near the end of the game tells a story so shocking, disturbing, and sad that parts of it actually play in fast motion so you don’t have to hear it. That’s how suppressing trauma works. You gloss over it, try to speed through your recollection of it so you don’t have to fully re-experience it. But of course, players were curious and slowed down this part of the “tape” to hear what really happened.</p>
<p>After they did, they could never look at Travis the same way again. His story, and the story of his family, was a true tragedy. All this time, he’d been fighting to try to make peace with his shared familial trauma, to somehow make it right.</p>
<p>But you can’t go back in time and kill the past. All you can do is move forward. That’s something Travis finally starts to do in his next game.</p>

<h3><em><strong>No More Heroes 1.5</strong></em></h3>
<p>But before we get to the next chapter in Travis’ life, let’s talk a little about this largely unknown side story. The Japanese special edition of <em>No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle</em> included a short animatic film called <em>No More Heroes 1.5</em>. It’s unessential but interesting; a bit of optional fun that sets the stage for the next major chapter in Travis’ life.</p>
<p>For the most part, he’s still the same guy, alone in a dead-end town. The main difference is, he’s become a famous assassin, and lower-level killers are gunning for his title. It’s a bit of symbolism that some may say is a smidge too on the nose: he even battles a guy who looks exactly like him. His first game had become a cult hit, and it got there by being like nothing else gaming had ever seen. With this sequel, <em>No More Heroes</em> would have to continue to compete against all the other games on the market, and also start fighting with itself. Comparisons between the new game and the old were inevitable.</p>
<p>Travis’ appeal hinged on his punk rock persona, his willingness to do what no other gaming mascot would. How could he preserve that unpredictable edge while also giving his fans the same fun they’d come to expect from him?</p>
<p>A hero is largely defined by their villains, and to move his story forward, Travis would need a new foe to juxtapose against. <em>No More Heroes 1.5</em> offers some foreshadowing on this new threat — a pizza mogul who’s looking to transform Travis’ town into a sterile, corporate wasteland. If Travis is Johnny Knoxville, a homegrown, do-it-yourself anti-celebrity, then his opposite would be a privileged, brand-obsessed brat, living his life in an ivory tower. Travis’ next full story would focus on the climb to topple this monster, and how the heights he’d reach to get there would give him plenty of room for a fall.</p>

<h3><em><strong>No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle</strong></em></h3>
<p>The <em>No More Heroes</em> games can be pretty blunt, so it feels right to just come out and say that <em>No More Heroes 2</em> failed as a product. <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-no-more-heroes-2-desperate-struggle/"" target=""_blank"">I love the game</a>, even more than the first — but the game just didn’t bring in the new fans that most game sequels are designed to attract. In fact, it may have actually lost some people.</p>
<p>Suda51 wrote and directed the first game, but by the second, he was juggling multiple projects. He wasn’t as involved with this one, and you can sense it. Everything here feels a little more self-conscious and catering. For fans who loved how the first game seemed too drunk to be tactful, too unhinged to be anything but fully authentic, <em>No More Heroes 2</em> seemed like a step towards conventionality by comparison.</p>
<p>Some critics picked on the first game for its large, and largely empty, open-world. The second one cut that entirely. The sometimes tedious menial jobs were also ditched, except for the scorpion one, because Suda seems to love the idea of Travis catching scorpions. All the others were replaced with breezy and delightful retro-style mini-games.</p>
<p>The story was also less toothy. Nothing in <em>No More Heroes 2</em> is so disturbing that it needs to be fast-forwarded over in order to keep it from getting an AO rating. Overall, it feels more like a crowd-pleaser; like a sophomore album by a hardcore band that’s going ever-so-slightly pop.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/VqfL0Ret1o8?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>But pop can also be deep. The story of <em>No More Heroes 2</em> is no less substantive than the first. It’s just told in a less overtly weird way. Things start with Travis being given a reason to seek revenge, and it’s flimsy as hell. At first blush, it may seem like just another ham-fisted MacGuffin, but it’s really a way to reframe Travis’ real defining trait: his loneliness. If your best friend is someone who you barely know or care about, you must not have many friends at all. That’s Travis at the start of <em>No More Heroes 2</em> — a more genuinely confident killer, but still a clown who doesn’t know how to connect.</p>
<p>Unlike the first game, which was mostly about unpeeling the layers of Travis’ psyche, the second <em>No More Heroes</em> is about how he changes. Through the game, he becomes a different person. His hot pursuit for revenge begins to burn a hole in him. It hurts, and not much makes it feel better. The body count piles up, and he begins to hate it, and himself. This pain motivates him to try something new: giving a shit about other people, and letting them into his life.</p>
<p>In the first game, the only person to ever enter Travis’ motel room is Travis. By the end of the second major chapter in his franchise, not one, not two, but three other people are invited in. Two of them are even playable characters! Travis, and the player, are learning to empathize, to see others outside themselves as just as real as them.</p>
<p>This increased capacity for intimacy comes to a head (literally) in the final fight. Though Travis seems a little too dumb to see it, the man who he came to hate so much is a lot like him. He’s alone, motivated by the urge to make others suffer as he has suffered, and he desires to amass power for power’s sake. But where do you have to go when you reach the top, when you finally cut off the head of a giant? The only place to go is down. Luckily for Travis, there’s someone there to catch him. The bonds he formed with friends and family turn out to be stronger than he thought. Strong enough to save him.</p>

<h3><strong><em>Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes</em></strong></h3>
<p>There was a nine-year span between <em>No More Heroes 2</em> and this spin-off, and that decade is reflected in the narrative. Travis has aged in real-time, and when we catch up with him, he looks more isolated than ever. How did he lose everything he gained in his last story? How did he end up in a trailer in the woods, alone with his cat, fending off attacks from drunken middle-aged baseball players?</p>
<p>At first, it seems like video games are to blame, but like most things with Travis, there’s a lot more to it than that.</p>
<p><em>Travis Strikes Again</em> is actually split into three different stories: the one told through cutscenes and gameplay, the one told through text-based faxes that Travis receives through his home-office fax machine, and the one told in a supplemental visual novel called <em>Travis Strikes Back</em>. All of these stories feel autobiographical. Suda51 was back in the director’s chair for this one, with at least nine years of pent-up ideas ready to go, and only a small “indie-style” side story with which to tell them.</p>
<p>At times it can all seem like too much, trying to follow the seemingly disconnected narrative threads, but they’re all connected. <em>Travis Strikes Again</em> is about Travis moving to the next big conflict in his life: the psycho-social stage of emotional development called Generativity vs. Stagnation. He may look to be alone at first, but before long, he’s fighting alongside one of the victims of his past crimes, trying to make it right. His pet is no longer just a silent companion, there to help him pass the time. They’re now a partnership, and one of many. Travis also doesn’t kill anymore, at least, not in the way he used to. Most of the enemies in the games are computer bugs, flaws in the system that Travis is working to fix. The bosses, like in past <em>No More Heroes</em> games, are an opportunity for Travis to reflect on himself, for better and for worse. Like Doppelganger, the last boss of the second level, is he nothing but a psychopathic killer who sees people as ants to be squashed? Or, like Eight-Hearts, a refugee of the damned, is he a gameplay tool that has evolved into a man; a full human being who is willing to die so something larger than himself can live?</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/C2Es76As7cA?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>Or would he rather just play video games and smoke drugs all day on another planet?</p>
<p>There are some yes or no answers to these questions, but it’s never that cut and dried. The fact that Travis is even asking them shows that he exists in the shades of grey between them. He wants to be a good person, but only because he knows that parts of him are genuinely bad. He loves video games, but he also knows that in a way, they can be life killers. In the end, it’s revealed that his real motivation is to take care of his family, even if that means never seeing them again. Is he making the right choices? It’s never clear. But that’s how he knows he’s alive, that he’s really challenging himself. That’s what grownup Travis is all about. He’s still media-obsessed, but he’s not anti-social anymore, despite his new life of self-imposed isolation.</p>
<p>This kind of self-contradiction, and the tension it creates, is classic Suda. Some were disappointed that<em> Travis Strikes Again</em> wasn’t a return to the classic <em>No More Heroes</em> gameplay, but diehard Suda fans saw it as a return to form for Grasshopper Manufacture, who had been growing more conventional over the years. This new, weird little game was Suda and Travis doing the things that only they would do, reflecting where Suda is as an artist at this point in his career, and inviting you to either come along or not.</p>
<p>Like every game in the series, it feels like it was made with no expectations of there ever being more. But there will be more very soon, and it’s hard not to talk about.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/d4jyB9jNamo?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<h3><strong>Looking ahead to No More Heroes 3</strong></h3>
<p>As of this writing, I’ve played through <em>No More Heroes 3</em> in a pre-release build, and then spent another eight hours just wandering around its open world, relaxing and looking for Easter eggs. I can’t say a lot due to the embargo, though I will tell you that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZocvme6cYc#t=1m5s"" target=""_blank"">Travis has struck again…. again</a>. Will the game be Suda’s biggest hit yet? Will it be in the right place at the right time, just like it was in its 2008 debut? If not, it won’t be for a lack of consistency. They could have called it<em> Super No More Heroes</em>, or maybe… <em>No More Super Heroes</em>? Like the classic “Super” games of the SNES era, like <em>Super Metroid</em> and <em>Super Castlevania IV</em>, it can be fully enjoyed without knowing the whole backstory, and without analyzing every story beat and word choice for some deeper meaning.</p>
<p>But if you like digging deeper, knowing who Travis is — and was — will make all the difference. I really, really can’t wait to see how the <em>No More Heroes</em> fan community reacts to this one. <a href=""https://twitter.com/suda_51/status/1420777507771453445"" target=""_blank"">I think they just might lose it</a>.</p>

From zero to no more hero
“If you identify with this loser, you have problems.”
That’s what Game Informer said about Travis Touchdown, the star of the No More Heroes series, in a list of “Top Ten Dorks of 2008.” Not the highest of praise, but in a way, they had a point. As it turns out, a lot of people who love games also happen to suffer from social anxiety, identity confusion, a history of trauma, and other problems. Like anyone, they want to see themselves represented in the media they enjoy, and when it comes to mass-market gaming, it can be tough to find honest representation. That’s still true now, and it was even more true 13 years ago.
In an industry striving for AAA, 10/10 perfection, Travis busted in screaming “I’m a big, broken idiot!”, and we loved him for it. Seeing him ridiculed by the establishment could be frustrating, but in the end, it only added to his time-tested, underdog charm. With three sequels, a Mii costume in Smash Bros., and even a jazz album (!) under his belt, Travis has proven that losers like him can win. Not bad for an old dork from 2008.
With its third, and maybe final numbered game on the horizon, No More Heroes curiosity is at an all-time high, and what better way to both satisfy that curiosity and, er, “stoke” it than with a video game blog! If you’ve always wanted to know more about the franchise, or if you’re just looking to refresh your memory on Travis’ history, here’s a spoiler-free, sometimes cryptic, recap of the No More Heroes story so far.

No More Heroes 
Travis kicks off his first story with a hyper-active monologue about how he bought a beam katana online and plans to use it to become a great assassin. From the start, the game rides the line between parody and tribute. Is it making fun of “cool nerds and the games they love,” or is it glorifying them? Can it do both at the same time? The tension in that question buzzes below the surface for the entirety of No More Heroes‘ run-time.
Travis is a powerful warrior who takes on hordes of blood-thirsty rivals all at once. He’s the textbook definition of a “cool, badass action hero.” The way he’s forced to do the “jerk off” motion with his sword in front of everyone in order to recharge it, leaving him vulnerable to both physical and emotional attacks at the same time? That’s less “badass” and more “jackass,” and that split down the middle between stud and dud doesn’t end there. He gets two kinds of phone calls every day: invitations to an underground society of assassins, and voicemails from the local video store listing all the pornos he owes late fees on. He splits his time between menial work and murdering murderers.
For a lot of us, Travis is how we look in a funhouse mirror — ridiculously exaggerated, volatile, but still a reflection of reality. He’s a guy we can both laugh at and laugh with, look down on him with one eye, look up to with the other.

Isolation is the unifying factor in Travis’ fractured life. He has a cat, who he silently pets, and a minor acquaintance named Bishop, but other than that, he’s going it alone. Over the course of the game, we come to find that there are reasons for that. Travis didn’t enter the world of competitive killing just for shits and giggles. As his battles against the bosses become increasingly strange, it becomes clearer that No More Heroes isn’t just another dumb action-comedy. It’s about Travis’ love/hate relationship with violence, and with himself. He’s trapped by it, struggling to find the exit, and in the end, it seems never-ending. There’s joy and pain in that, and more than anything, there’s truth.
For many, No More Heroes was their gateway into this deeper world of symbolism-heavy “auteur gaming.” It sold itself with novelty and brutality, but that was just to get you in the door. Once it gets its hooks in you, it takes you to places you may not have otherwise chosen to go.

But you can’t go back in time and kill the past. All you can do is move forward. That’s something Travis finally starts to do in his next game.

No More Heroes 1.5
But before we get to the next chapter in Travis’ life, let’s talk a little about this largely unknown side story. The Japanese special edition of No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle included a short animatic film called No More Heroes 1.5. It’s unessential but interesting; a bit of optional fun that sets the stage for the next major chapter in Travis’ life.
For the most part, he’s still the same guy, alone in a dead-end town. The main difference is, he’s become a famous assassin, and lower-level killers are gunning for his title.

No More Heroes 1.5 offers some foreshadowing on this new threat — a pizza mogul who’s looking to transform Travis’ town into a sterile, corporate wasteland. If Travis is Johnny Knoxville, a homegrown, do-it-yourself anti-celebrity, then his opposite would be a privileged, brand-obsessed brat, living his life in an ivory tower. Travis’ next full story would focus on the climb to topple this monster, and how the heights he’d reach to get there would give him plenty of room for a fall.

No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle
The No More Heroes games can be pretty blunt, so it feels right to just come out and say that No More Heroes 2 failed as a product. I love the game, even more than the first — but the game just didn’t bring in the new fans that most game sequels are designed to attract. In fact, it may have actually lost some people.
Suda51 wrote and directed the first game, but by the second, he was juggling multiple projects. He wasn’t as involved with this one, and you can sense it. Everything here feels a little more self-conscious and catering. For fans who loved how the first game seemed too drunk to be tactful, too unhinged to be anything but fully authentic, No More Heroes 2 seemed like a step towards conventionality by comparison.
Some critics picked on the first game for its large, and largely empty, open-world. The second one cut that entirely. The sometimes tedious menial jobs were also ditched, except for the scorpion one, because Suda seems to love the idea of Travis catching scorpions. All the others were replaced with breezy and delightful retro-style mini-games.
The story was also less toothy. Nothing in No More Heroes 2 is so disturbing that it needs to be fast-forwarded over in order to keep it from getting an AO rating. Overall, it feels more like a crowd-pleaser; like a sophomore album by a hardcore band that’s going ever-so-slightly pop.

But pop can also be deep. The story of No More Heroes 2 is no less substantive than the first. It’s just told in a less overtly weird way. Things start with Travis being given a reason to seek revenge, and it’s flimsy as hell. At first blush, it may seem like just another ham-fisted MacGuffin, but it’s really a way to reframe Travis’ real defining trait: his loneliness. If your best friend is someone who you barely know or care about, you must not have many friends at all. That’s Travis at the start of No More Heroes 2 — a more genuinely confident killer, but still a clown who doesn’t know how to connect.

His hot pursuit for revenge begins to burn a hole in him. It hurts, and not much makes it feel better. The body count piles up, and he begins to hate it, and himself. This pain motivates him to try something new: giving a shit about other people, and letting them into his life.
In the first game, the only person to ever enter Travis’ motel room is Travis. By the end of the second major chapter in his franchise, not one, not two, but three other people are invited in. Two of them are even playable characters! Travis, and the player, are learning to empathize, to see others outside themselves as just as real as them.
This increased capacity for intimacy comes to a head (literally) in the final fight. Though Travis seems a little too dumb to see it, the man who he came to hate so much is a lot like him. He’s alone, motivated by the urge to make others suffer as he has suffered, and he desires to amass power for power’s sake. But where do you have to go when you reach the top, when you finally cut off the head of a giant? The only place to go is down. Luckily for Travis, there’s someone there to catch him. The bonds he formed with friends and family turn out to be stronger than he thought. Strong enough to save him.

Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes
There was a nine-year span between No More Heroes 2 and this spin-off, and that decade is reflected in the narrative. Travis has aged in real-time, and when we catch up with him, he looks more isolated than ever. How did he lose everything he gained in his last story? How did he end up in a trailer in the woods, alone with his cat, fending off attacks from drunken middle-aged baseball players?
At first, it seems like video games are to blame, but like most things with Travis, there’s a lot more to it than that.
Travis Strikes Again is actually split into three different stories: the one told through cutscenes and gameplay, the one told through text-based faxes that Travis receives through his home-office fax machine, and the one told in a supplemental visual novel called Travis Strikes Back. All of these stories feel autobiographical. Suda51 was back in the director’s chair for this one, with at least nine years of pent-up ideas ready to go, and only a small “indie-style” side story with which to tell them.
At times it can all seem like too much, trying to follow the seemingly disconnected narrative threads, but they’re all connected. Travis Strikes Again is about Travis moving to the next big conflict in his life: the psycho-social stage of emotional development called Generativity vs. Stagnation. He may look to be alone at first, but before long, he’s fighting alongside one of the victims of his past crimes, trying to make it right. His pet is no longer just a silent companion, there to help him pass the time. They’re now a partnership, and one of many. Travis also doesn’t kill anymore, at least, not in the way he used to. Most of the enemies in the games are computer bugs, flaws in the system that Travis is working to fix. The bosses, like in past No More Heroes games, are an opportunity for Travis to reflect on himself, for better and for worse. Like Doppelganger, the last boss of the second level, is he nothing but a psychopathic killer who sees people as ants to be squashed? Or, like Eight-Hearts, a refugee of the damned, is he a gameplay tool that has evolved into a man; a full human being who is willing to die so something larger than himself can live?

Or would he rather just play video games and smoke drugs all day on another planet?
There are some yes or no answers to these questions, but it’s never that cut and dried. The fact that Travis is even asking them shows that he exists in the shades of grey between them. He wants to be a good person, but only because he knows that parts of him are genuinely bad. He loves video games, but he also knows that in a way, they can be life killers. In the end, it’s revealed that his real motivation is to take care of his family, even if that means never seeing them again. Is he making the right choices? It’s never clear. But that’s how he knows he’s alive, that he’s really challenging himself. That’s what grownup Travis is all about. He’s still media-obsessed, but he’s not anti-social anymore, despite his new life of self-imposed isolation.
This kind of self-contradiction, and the tension it creates, is classic Suda. Some were disappointed that Travis Strikes Again wasn’t a return to the classic No More Heroes gameplay, but diehard Suda fans saw it as a return to form for Grasshopper Manufacture, who had been growing more conventional over the years. This new, weird little game was Suda and Travis doing the things that only they would do, reflecting where Suda is as an artist at this point in his career, and inviting you to either come along or not.
Like every game in the series, it feels like it was made with no expectations of there ever being more. But there will be more very soon, and it’s hard not to talk about.

Looking ahead to No More Heroes 3
As of this writing, I’ve played through No More Heroes 3 in a pre-release build, and then spent another eight hours just wandering around its open world, relaxing and looking for Easter eggs. I can’t say a lot due to the embargo, though I will tell you that Travis has struck again…. again. Will the game be Suda’s biggest hit yet? Will it be in the right place at the right time, just like it was in its 2008 debut? If not, it won’t be for a lack of consistency. They could have called it Super No More Heroes, or maybe… No More Super Heroes? Like the classic “Super” games of the SNES era, like Super Metroid and Super Castlevania IV, it can be fully enjoyed without knowing the whole backstory, and without analyzing every story beat and word choice for some deeper meaning.
But if you like digging deeper, knowing who Travis is — and was — will make all the difference. I really, really can’t wait to see how the No More Heroes fan community reacts to this one. I think they just might lose it.

<p>Square Enix has revealed some of the exciting new features that are coming to <em>Tactics Ogre: Reborn</em>, bringing its fantasy worlds and strategic gameplay to a whole new audience of players. The beautifully detailed backgrounds and splash art have been fully recreated in high-definition, while the classic pixel appearance of the in-game characters has been tweaked to be crisper than ever before, while still retaining their delightful retro appeal.

<p>Under the hood, a plethora of tweaks has been made to <em>Tactics Ogre</em>‘s strategic gameplay. A newly-designed A.I. unit hopes to offer smarter and more adaptive enemies, while the class-wide leveling system has been replaced with a new unit-specific leveling system, offering more fine-tuning opportunities for individual units. This way, players can be a little more scalpel-precise when it comes to putting together their offensive forces.</p>
<p>As is the case for so many modern remakes,<em> Tactics Ogre: Reborn</em> will feature several “quality of life” features, such as battle speed selection, quick save/load, and tips and tutorials to help brand new players get to grips with the RPG’s mechanics and battle system in double-quick time. Square Enix hopes that this ground-up overhaul of both the audio/visual and mechanical content will optimize <em>Tactics Ogre</em> for modern players, while retaining the charm, drama, and engaging action recognized by long-time fans.</p>

<h2>The CMA is looking into whether this deal is anti-competitive</h2>
<p>The Competition and Markets Authority is looking into Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The UK regulator is officially looking into whether the deal could be anti-competitive.</p>
<p>September 1 is the deadline for the first phase of the investigation. In this phase, the CMA will determine whether Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal could harm competition, and if it should launch an in-depth investigation. It’s also inviting comments on the transaction from any interested party.</p>
<p>“As with all merger reviews, this investigation will consider whether the deal could harm competition and lead to worse outcomes for consumers—for example, through higher prices, lower quality, or reduced choice,” the CMA said (via <a href=""https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2022-07-06-uk-regulator-investigating-microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition"" target=""_blank"">GamesIndustry.biz</a>).</p>
<p>Microsoft corporate VP and general counsel Lisa Tanzi said (via <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/06/microsofts-69-billion-activision-takeover-faces-competition-probe-in-the-uk.html"" target=""_blank"">CNBC</a>) that regulatory scrutiny of the deal was to be expected. Microsoft will “fully cooperate” with the CMA.</p>
<p>“We’re committed to answering questions from regulators and ultimately believe a thorough review will help the deal close with broad confidence, and that it will be positive for competition,” said Tanzi. She also added that Microsoft remains “confident” the deal will close in fiscal year 2023.</p>

<h2>A massive merger</h2>
<p>The scrutiny isn’t a surprise, especially with a deal as big as Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard. The CMA in the UK is not the only one looking into it, either. The FTC is also investigating the deal, as chair Lina Khan <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-16/ftc-scrutinizing-labor-impact-of-microsoft-activision-merger"" target=""_blank"">told lawmakers in June</a>. The FTC’s investigation will look at, among other things, how the deal would impact workers at Activision Blizzard.</p>
<p>The $68.7 billion deal was announced in <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-purchase-acquisition-call-of-duty-warcraft/"" target=""_blank"">January</a>, and made a lot of waves. With a portfolio of games including <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Diablo</em>, <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Warcraft</em>, and much more, it could be a huge deal for Microsoft once the ink dries.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

The CMA is looking into whether this deal is anti-competitive
The Competition and Markets Authority is looking into Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The UK regulator is officially looking into whether the deal could be anti-competitive.
September 1 is the deadline for the first phase of the investigation. In this phase, the CMA will determine whether Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal could harm competition, and if it should launch an in-depth investigation. It’s also inviting comments on the transaction from any interested party.
“As with all merger reviews, this investigation will consider whether the deal could harm competition and lead to worse outcomes for consumers—for example, through higher prices, lower quality, or reduced choice,” the CMA said (via GamesIndustry.biz).
Microsoft corporate VP and general counsel Lisa Tanzi said (via CNBC) that regulatory scrutiny of the deal was to be expected. Microsoft will “fully cooperate” with the CMA.
“We’re committed to answering questions from regulators and ultimately believe a thorough review will help the deal close with broad confidence, and that it will be positive for competition,” said Tanzi. She also added that Microsoft remains “confident” the deal will close in fiscal year 2023.

A massive merger
The scrutiny isn’t a surprise, especially with a deal as big as Microsoft acquiring Activision Blizzard. The CMA in the UK is not the only one looking into it, either. The FTC is also investigating the deal, as chair Lina Khan told lawmakers in June. The FTC’s investigation will look at, among other things, how the deal would impact workers at Activision Blizzard.
The $68.7 billion deal was announced in January, and made a lot of waves. With a portfolio of games including Call of Duty, Diablo, Overwatch, Warcraft, and much more, it could be a huge deal for Microsoft once the ink dries.


 


						
	
		Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs
Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.
The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.

In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.
The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.

For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.

<p>The next generation of <em>Street Fighter </em>is aiming for 2023. Today, we got a look at what’s in store for <em>Street Fighter 6 </em>with some new trailers, featuring fighters, commentary, and a new single-player mode.</p>
<p>Today’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZud-p0QRvA"" target=""_blank"">State of Play trailer</a> showed some full-on fights in the new engine, which <a href=""https://blog.playstation.com/2022/06/02/street-fighter-6-aims-to-redefine-the-fighting-genre-in-2023/"" target=""_blank"">according to the PlayStation blog</a> is Capcom’s own RE Engine. The general look is a bit more colorful, with lots of paint and graffiti splashes.</p>
<p>As for the roster? First up are two newcomers. Well, relative newcomers; Luke already <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/street-fighter-v-update-luke-nerf-capcom-patch-notes/"" target=""_blank"">made his debut</a> in <em>Street Fighter V</em> as a preview of what’s in store. He uses mixed martial arts and can pull off DDTs on people. Jamie, meanwhile, is a peacekeeper who follows in the footsteps of Yun and Yang. Returning to the roster are also Ryu and Chun-Li, who need little introduction.</p>

<h2>The Drive System</h2>
<p>The new mechanic this time is the <strong>Drive System</strong>, which can be used to perform five different techniques based on what you need. A Drive Reversal, for example, can perform a counterattack to get out of a sticky spot. Drive Parry, meanwhile, parries an attack and refills the Drive Gauge. Drive Impact looks similar to a Focus Attack, as it’s a powerful hit that can absorb an attack and can wall splat.</p>

<p>With Drive Rush, you can close the distance quick. And Overdrive Arts are essentially EX Moves, powering up Special Moves. It seems like a lot at first, but also combines a lot of different ideas from <em>Street Fighter </em>past into one universal metric.</p>
<h2>Switching up controls</h2>
<p>Another big note from today’s reveal and corresponding blog post is a new control system. For those used to classic <em>Street Fighter </em>inputs, there is Classic Control Type. It’s the good ol’ six-button layout and regular inputs.</p>
<p>In <em>Street Fighter 6</em> though, there will also be a Modern Control Type, which allows special moves to be performed by combining a Special Move button with a directional input. Games like <em><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/granblue-fantasy-versus-wants-players-of-all-skill-levels-to-experience-its-splendor/"" target=""_blank"">Granblue: Fantasy Versus</a> </em>have implemented similar systems in the past, and now it looks like <em>Street Fighter </em>is hopping on the train.</p>

<p>A Real Time Commentary is also being added, where Capcom will collaborate with real-life fighting game commentators to add their voices into the game. They’ll narrate your play and add that tournament feel to matches. Vicious and Aru are the first confirmed additions, and the rest of the lineup is on the way later.</p>
<p>Capcom also showed two different modes: World Tour and Battle Hub. World Tour is an “immersive” single-player story mode where you’ll have a player avatar. And Battle Hub looks like a massive thunderdome venue for online matches. They were only teased, as Capcom says both modes will get a deeper dive in the future.</p>

<p>It was a pretty stacked debut for <em>Street Fighter 6 </em>at the State of Play today. But it does seem like <em>Street Fighter </em>is taking some leaps with its next generation. The new challenger aims to arrive in 2023 for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

<p>Are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night? Do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic? Have you or your family ever seen a spook, specter or ghost?</p>
<p>If the answer is “yes,” the professionals, the Ghostbusters, would recommend that you call them right away. Thankfully, they are very accessible these days, with their multiplatform game, <i>Ghostbusters: The Video Game</i>. We’ve read <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/review-ghostbusters-136795.phtml"" target=""_blank"">some thoughts</a> on the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of the game, but what if you want or need to exorcise evil spirits through your Nintendo Wii?</p>
<p>Have no fear, because rookie Ghostbusters Ashley Davis and Anthony Burch are ready to believe you. They have played through the entire game to help you in your time of need. The first reviewer gives her take on the game without influence from the other versions (though she <i>is</i> working on getting through them), while the second examines how the different versions stack up, having played both home console games in full (he has way too much time on his hands).</p>
<p>Hit the jump to see their thoughts, and whether or not they continue to constantly quote the movie throughout the review (they can’t help it, they’re nerds).</p>
<p><img title=""We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/137687_g1-noscale.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<p><b><i>Ghostbusters: The Video Game</i></b><b> (Wii)</b><b><br />
Developer: Red Fly Studio<br />
Publisher: Atari</b><br />
<b>Released: June 16, 2009<br />
MSRP: $39.99</b></p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/img.photobucket.com/albums/v77/jailbird/ash.png?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" /> <b>Ashley Davis</b></p>
<p>All the various versions of <i>Ghostbusters: The Video Game</i> is about the closest thing we will ever get to a <i>Ghostbusters 3</i>, and fans of the property ought to rejoice its presence, as it is one of the more solid movie games to have ever been made. Although the Wii version feels more like a five hour long playable <i>Ghostbusters</i> cartoon than anything else, that does not make it any less deserving of the franchise name.</p>
<p>It gives off a lot of the same nostalgic vibes that its source material has for the past 20 years, with some great dialogue and a new storyline that could have been ripped directly from another movie sequel. There are lots of visits to familiar locations, and many of the faces to be seen are ones that we’ve all seen before, but because we have never had the opportunity to fight alongside the Ghostbusters before, it all feels somewhat new again. The AI behind the Ghostbuster crew isn’t the best ever, but they are pretty good about helping out with large crowds of enemies and not getting in the way. The game is separated into several small chunks of story, with a boss fight and a trip back to headquarters every three levels or so. This makes it all very easy to pick up and put down at one’s leisure.</p>
<p><img title=""Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, no job is too big, no fee is too big."" src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/137687_g10-noscale.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""z"" /></p>
<p>The controls are as simple as simple gets. You move with the Nunchuk, aim with the Wiimote and press B to shoot. The D-pad scrolls through the three different weapons (Blast Stream, Slime Blower, Shock Blast) and the PKE Meter. Each of these has a secondary function that can be performed by pressing A. The learning curve needed to become a great Ghostbuster is not at all steep, which makes it easy for anyone to jump right in and play like they’ve been busting ghosts all their lives.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best part of the game is that the whole thing can be played cooperatively. A friend can join you for some split screen action whenever you start a new game, continue a saved game, or go back to play a previous level. Running around, trapping ghosts and solving puzzles with your various guns is pretty fun, especially if you have a friend to do it with. In addition to helping each other out, you can slime one another and cross your streams (this, of course, results in instadeath) just for kicks. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t let the second player stray too far from the first, making it hard to split up and do more damage. on larger maps. Otherwise, the game is very well-tailored to fit in two players, with enough enemies and things to do for everyone. It even gives turns to each player when they are slamming around the same spook.</p>
<p><img title=""I had half a Slinky, but I straightened it."" src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/137687_g6-noscale.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""dd"" /></p>
<p>While <i>Ghostbusters</i> is generally good times, the game does have its flaws. There were a few slight problems with the game’s otherwise great control scheme. As is usual with Wii games, these problems concern the few actions that are mapped to motion controls. I had some problems getting the game to register my flicking up and down. Left and right were quite a bit better, but the down motion is needed to get through some puzzles near the end of the game. My problems with getting the flicks to pick up made these portions a lot harder and frustrating than they needed to be, but thankfully, there were only one or two situations where this issue tested my patience.</p>
<p>One very small issue with the gameplay itself is that there is never much of an incentive to use anything other than the Blast Stream in most combat situations, and the puzzles that do use the others aren’t terribly varied. For the better part of the game, I used the Blast Stream and its secondary, the Boson Dart. The latter weapon is a bit <i>too</i> powerful, knocking off a good chunk of health off of any enemy you may come across. I would have liked a little more variation in weapon usage both in and out of combat, if only to help keep the combat from growing stale.</p>
<p>From the lowly (in regards to power) Slimer to the biggest specters, all of the ghosts in the game must be weakened, slammed around, and then roped into a standard ghost trap, thrown by a press of the Z button. Some enemies do need a little dousing in slime or dark matter to start off with, but the other weapons are never used for more than a few seconds before switching back to the old standby. There are a scant few cool puzzles using the other two guns, but they really could have done so many more neat things to integrate them better with the gameplay. The PKE Meter, on the other hand, is very intuitive and useful. When equipped, it simply leads you to the nearest supernatural activity. A press of the A button will equip you with PKE Goggles, enabling you to clearly see the paranormal goings-on around you. This can be a hidden ghost, items that can be interacted with, the weak points of a boss, and even invisible platforms that are poking into the real world through the Ghostworld.</p>
<p><img title=""&quot;This is a great plan! I'm excited to be a part of it!&quot;"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/137687_g11-noscale.jpg?resize=620%2C300&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""z"" /></p>
<p>The boss fights lend a big hand in keeping things interesting too. Sure they’re all dragged into a trap at the end, but the weakening process differs wonderfully from one to the other. In one boss fight, the player must shoot the boss’s projectiles back at it, and then rip out one of its many tongues with the capture stream while it is recuperating. In another, one can only hurt the boss by destroying the safety net under it and knocking it off the wall, causing it to hit the ground hard. Each one utilizes a different weapon as well. Most of the boss fights are a great reward for getting through an area, even more so if you find yourself getting tired of the same old song and dance on the way there.</p>
<p>The biggest annoyance by far is the game’s collectibles, which are pages from Tobin’s Spirit Guide that are strewn all over each level. Every time you pick one of these pages up, regardless of whether or not you’re in the middle of a fight, the screen switches over to the Guide to show you what’s on the page you just found. There is no reason for this screen to pop up every time you get a new page when you can access the guide at any time from the pause menu. It jolts you out of the action for nothing. I eventually started to avoid collecting the pages altogether, as they aren’t much use other than for 100 percent completion.</p>
<p><img title=""&quot;The flowers are STILL standing!&quot;"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/137687_g2-noscale.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""z"" /></p>
<p>On the graphical side of things, there’s nothing too special here besides the nice, cartoony style of the characters (although the designs have <a href=""https://www.truegameheadz.com/blogheadz/talented-character-designer-for-ghostbusters-wii-gets-the-shaft/"" target=""_blank"">questionable origins</a>). At best, the game looks like it belongs on the Playstation 2, and that’s really a shame, as much better can and has been done on the Wii. There is also some noticeable slowdown while fighting lots of respawning, flying enemies, which happens a few times near the end of the game. The score is taken straight from the movies, but isn’t too varied. On the other hand, the dialogue is humorous and the voice acting top notch (with the exception of Alyssa Milano’s work, which is rather uninspired). Some of the lines differ from what is spoken to the subtitles, assumedly to keep the game safely nestled in its E rating. There are enough references and familiar lines grouped with some great new quotes to make any fan delighted.</p>
<p>The Wii version of <i>Ghostbusters: The Video Game</i> is by no means the perfect game, but it is a great movie-to-game adaptation, and a very fun and entertaining way to spend some time with some old friends if you’re a Wii-owning <i>Ghostbusters</i> lover. As this is a <i>very</i> character and story driven videogame, if you’re not a fan of the movies or the humor within them, you may not be as tolerant of the easy and somewhat repetitive gameplay as those who dig the characters and story might. The intuitive gameplay, interesting boss fights, and ability to co-op are plusses for all gamers, while the easy difficulty level and short game length are some of the negatives. It could be a buy for the biggest <i>Ghostbusters</i> fans, but I would definitely recommend this game as a rental first for most.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/the-official-destructoid-review-guide-ver-2-0-103621.phtml"" target=""_blank""><b>Score</b>:</a> <b>6 </b></p>
<p><b>Anthony Burch:</b></p>
<p>As someone who played through the 360 version of <i>Ghostbusters</i> twice in the span of a week, I could not help but constantly compare the Wii version against it all throughout my single playthrough. In the end, one version felt more satisfying to me than the other — but not by <i>much</i>.</p>
<p>For every forward step the Wii version takes past its 360 counterpart, it unfortunately takes another step back. In the 360 version, for instance, the later levels included poorly designed, restart-heavy combat sections where you entire team might be slaughtered in an instant. The Wii version is much easier on normal difficulty and mitigates the frustration of constant, unfair death, but at the expense of becoming somewhat dull and redundant in the game’s latter missions. I truly can’t count how many times I’d walk into a room, only to have the doors forced shut by a magical force that refused to open them until I’d captured every single ghost in the room. The level design and progression structure are almost totally different from version to version: entire sections from the New York and Ghostworld levels have been totally excised from the Wii version, and many of the levels that both versions share have been significantly cut down for the Wii. In itself, this isn’t necessarily a good or bad thing (though I really, really miss the Super Trap level right before the Stay Puft fight); it’s just <i>different</i>.</p>
<p><img title=""&quot;There are many perks to being the mother of a living god.&quot;"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/137687_g3-620x.jpg?resize=620%2C300&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""erere"" /></p>
<p>The Wii version’s <a href=""https://traditionaldanimatio.deviantart.com/gallery/?2138218#Ghostbusters"" target=""_blank"">poorly credited</a> art style not only effectively embraces the Wii’s technical limitations while still retaining an essential <i>Ghostbusters</i> feel, it also removes one of the most glaring faults with the 360 and PS3 versions — Bill Murray’s dialogue. When Peter Venkman looked like a regular dude, his over-the-top lines felt forced and irritating. When Peter Venkman looks like a cartoony version of his former self, his lines somehow work much better. A few Venkman quotes that originally made me roll my eyes actually elicited smirks this time around. The tradeoff for this is that the game’s cartoonified Ray Stantz more resembles a talking baked potato than Dan Aykroyd.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting, though, that all of Venkman’s sexual innuendos — both of them — have been excised in order to keep an “E” rating. It’s all right, though, because there’s a lot of new and alternate dialogue in the Wii version you won’t find anywhere else, almost all of it good.</p>
<p>The 360 version focused far more on combat, often to its detriment — by the halfway point, the game felt remarkably similar to any other 3rd-person shooter you could name. The Wii version, conversely, puts a much greater focus on the puzzles Ashley described above. Where the 360 version might only use a weapon like the Stasis Stream to make the process of bustin’ ghosts easier, the Wii version at one point had Davis and I running through a corridor  made of huge, turning gears that could only be traversed by well-timed blasts from our proton freeze ray. A couple of the puzzles are genuinely imaginative, and often more interesting than much of the repetitive combat that fills the 360 version’s latter half.</p>
<p><img title=""&quot;I looked at the trap, Ray.&quot;"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/137687_g4-620x.jpg?resize=620%2C300&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""ere"" /></p>
<p>It’s a good thing, too, because most of the combat in Wii <i>Ghostbusters</i> is tedious and unsatisfying. Don’t get me wrong, it feels <i>great</i> to tear up the environment with an IR sensor-controlled proton pack, and moderately satisfying to throw out a trap by holding down the Z button and swinging your arm forward. The main problem is that the simple process of bustin’ a ghost is nowhere near as compelling or well-paced as it is in the other versions of the game. After doing enough damage to an apparition with the proton pack, the ghost can be wrangled. In the 360 version, this means you can either start pressing the L trigger to slam him into walls and floors at your leisure until you feel like dragging him into the trap.</p>
<p>In the Wii version, this means you have to play through a poorly paced, barely interactive game of simon says. A big red arrow appears on the ghost telling you to slam him to the right, so you flick your Wiimote to the right. Then, a short pause.

Are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night? Do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic? Have you or your family ever seen a spook, specter or ghost?
If the answer is “yes,” the professionals, the Ghostbusters, would recommend that you call them right away. Thankfully, they are very accessible these days, with their multiplatform game, Ghostbusters: The Video Game. We’ve read some thoughts on the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of the game, but what if you want or need to exorcise evil spirits through your Nintendo Wii?
Have no fear, because rookie Ghostbusters Ashley Davis and Anthony Burch are ready to believe you. They have played through the entire game to help you in your time of need. The first reviewer gives her take on the game without influence from the other versions (though she is working on getting through them), while the second examines how the different versions stack up, having played both home console games in full (he has way too much time on his hands).
Hit the jump to see their thoughts, and whether or not they continue to constantly quote the movie throughout the review (they can’t help it, they’re nerds).

Ghostbusters: The Video Game (Wii)
Developer: Red Fly Studio
Publisher: Atari
Released: June 16, 2009
MSRP: $39.99
 Ashley Davis
All the various versions of Ghostbusters: The Video Game is about the closest thing we will ever get to a Ghostbusters 3, and fans of the property ought to rejoice its presence, as it is one of the more solid movie games to have ever been made. Although the Wii version feels more like a five hour long playable Ghostbusters cartoon than anything else, that does not make it any less deserving of the franchise name.
It gives off a lot of the same nostalgic vibes that its source material has for the past 20 years, with some great dialogue and a new storyline that could have been ripped directly from another movie sequel. There are lots of visits to familiar locations, and many of the faces to be seen are ones that we’ve all seen before, but because we have never had the opportunity to fight alongside the Ghostbusters before, it all feels somewhat new again. The AI behind the Ghostbuster crew isn’t the best ever, but they are pretty good about helping out with large crowds of enemies and not getting in the way. The game is separated into several small chunks of story, with a boss fight and a trip back to headquarters every three levels or so. This makes it all very easy to pick up and put down at one’s leisure.

The controls are as simple as simple gets. You move with the Nunchuk, aim with the Wiimote and press B to shoot. The D-pad scrolls through the three different weapons (Blast Stream, Slime Blower, Shock Blast) and the PKE Meter. Each of these has a secondary function that can be performed by pressing A. The learning curve needed to become a great Ghostbuster is not at all steep, which makes it easy for anyone to jump right in and play like they’ve been busting ghosts all their lives.
Perhaps the best part of the game is that the whole thing can be played cooperatively. A friend can join you for some split screen action whenever you start a new game, continue a saved game, or go back to play a previous level. Running around, trapping ghosts and solving puzzles with your various guns is pretty fun, especially if you have a friend to do it with. In addition to helping each other out, you can slime one another and cross your streams (this, of course, results in instadeath) just for kicks. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t let the second player stray too far from the first, making it hard to split up and do more damage. on larger maps. Otherwise, the game is very well-tailored to fit in two players, with enough enemies and things to do for everyone. It even gives turns to each player when they are slamming around the same spook.

While Ghostbusters is generally good times, the game does have its flaws. There were a few slight problems with the game’s otherwise great control scheme. As is usual with Wii games, these problems concern the few actions that are mapped to motion controls. I had some problems getting the game to register my flicking up and down. Left and right were quite a bit better, but the down motion is needed to get through some puzzles near the end of the game. My problems with getting the flicks to pick up made these portions a lot harder and frustrating than they needed to be, but thankfully, there were only one or two situations where this issue tested my patience.
One very small issue with the gameplay itself is that there is never much of an incentive to use anything other than the Blast Stream in most combat situations, and the puzzles that do use the others aren’t terribly varied. For the better part of the game, I used the Blast Stream and its secondary, the Boson Dart. The latter weapon is a bit too powerful, knocking off a good chunk of health off of any enemy you may come across. I would have liked a little more variation in weapon usage both in and out of combat, if only to help keep the combat from growing stale.
From the lowly (in regards to power) Slimer to the biggest specters, all of the ghosts in the game must be weakened, slammed around, and then roped into a standard ghost trap, thrown by a press of the Z button. Some enemies do need a little dousing in slime or dark matter to start off with, but the other weapons are never used for more than a few seconds before switching back to the old standby. There are a scant few cool puzzles using the other two guns, but they really could have done so many more neat things to integrate them better with the gameplay. The PKE Meter, on the other hand, is very intuitive and useful. When equipped, it simply leads you to the nearest supernatural activity. A press of the A button will equip you with PKE Goggles, enabling you to clearly see the paranormal goings-on around you. This can be a hidden ghost, items that can be interacted with, the weak points of a boss, and even invisible platforms that are poking into the real world through the Ghostworld.

The boss fights lend a big hand in keeping things interesting too. Sure they’re all dragged into a trap at the end, but the weakening process differs wonderfully from one to the other. In one boss fight, the player must shoot the boss’s projectiles back at it, and then rip out one of its many tongues with the capture stream while it is recuperating. In another, one can only hurt the boss by destroying the safety net under it and knocking it off the wall, causing it to hit the ground hard. Each one utilizes a different weapon as well. Most of the boss fights are a great reward for getting through an area, even more so if you find yourself getting tired of the same old song and dance on the way there.
The biggest annoyance by far is the game’s collectibles, which are pages from Tobin’s Spirit Guide that are strewn all over each level. Every time you pick one of these pages up, regardless of whether or not you’re in the middle of a fight, the screen switches over to the Guide to show you what’s on the page you just found. There is no reason for this screen to pop up every time you get a new page when you can access the guide at any time from the pause menu. It jolts you out of the action for nothing. I eventually started to avoid collecting the pages altogether, as they aren’t much use other than for 100 percent completion.

On the graphical side of things, there’s nothing too special here besides the nice, cartoony style of the characters (although the designs have questionable origins). At best, the game looks like it belongs on the Playstation 2, and that’s really a shame, as much better can and has been done on the Wii. There is also some noticeable slowdown while fighting lots of respawning, flying enemies, which happens a few times near the end of the game. The score is taken straight from the movies, but isn’t too varied. On the other hand, the dialogue is humorous and the voice acting top notch (with the exception of Alyssa Milano’s work, which is rather uninspired). Some of the lines differ from what is spoken to the subtitles, assumedly to keep the game safely nestled in its E rating. There are enough references and familiar lines grouped with some great new quotes to make any fan delighted.
The Wii version of Ghostbusters: The Video Game is by no means the perfect game, but it is a great movie-to-game adaptation, and a very fun and entertaining way to spend some time with some old friends if you’re a Wii-owning Ghostbusters lover. As this is a very character and story driven videogame, if you’re not a fan of the movies or the humor within them, you may not be as tolerant of the easy and somewhat repetitive gameplay as those who dig the characters and story might. The intuitive gameplay, interesting boss fights, and ability to co-op are plusses for all gamers, while the easy difficulty level and short game length are some of the negatives. It could be a buy for the biggest Ghostbusters fans, but I would definitely recommend this game as a rental first for most.
Score: 6 
Anthony Burch:
As someone who played through the 360 version of Ghostbusters twice in the span of a week, I could not help but constantly compare the Wii version against it all throughout my single playthrough. In the end, one version felt more satisfying to me than the other — but not by much.
For every forward step the Wii version takes past its 360 counterpart, it unfortunately takes another step back. In the 360 version, for instance, the later levels included poorly designed, restart-heavy combat sections where you entire team might be slaughtered in an instant. The Wii version is much easier on normal difficulty and mitigates the frustration of constant, unfair death, but at the expense of becoming somewhat dull and redundant in the game’s latter missions. I truly can’t count how many times I’d walk into a room, only to have the doors forced shut by a magical force that refused to open them until I’d captured every single ghost in the room. The level design and progression structure are almost totally different from version to version: entire sections from the New York and Ghostworld levels have been totally excised from the Wii version, and many of the levels that both versions share have been significantly cut down for the Wii. In itself, this isn’t necessarily a good or bad thing (though I really, really miss the Super Trap level right before the Stay Puft fight); it’s just different.

The Wii version’s poorly credited art style not only effectively embraces the Wii’s technical limitations while still retaining an essential Ghostbusters feel, it also removes one of the most glaring faults with the 360 and PS3 versions — Bill Murray’s dialogue. When Peter Venkman looked like a regular dude, his over-the-top lines felt forced and irritating. When Peter Venkman looks like a cartoony version of his former self, his lines somehow work much better. A few Venkman quotes that originally made me roll my eyes actually elicited smirks this time around. The tradeoff for this is that the game’s cartoonified Ray Stantz more resembles a talking baked potato than Dan Aykroyd.
It’s worth noting, though, that all of Venkman’s sexual innuendos — both of them — have been excised in order to keep an “E” rating. It’s all right, though, because there’s a lot of new and alternate dialogue in the Wii version you won’t find anywhere else, almost all of it good.
The 360 version focused far more on combat, often to its detriment — by the halfway point, the game felt remarkably similar to any other 3rd-person shooter you could name. The Wii version, conversely, puts a much greater focus on the puzzles Ashley described above. Where the 360 version might only use a weapon like the Stasis Stream to make the process of bustin’ ghosts easier, the Wii version at one point had Davis and I running through a corridor  made of huge, turning gears that could only be traversed by well-timed blasts from our proton freeze ray. A couple of the puzzles are genuinely imaginative, and often more interesting than much of the repetitive combat that fills the 360 version’s latter half.

It’s a good thing, too, because most of the combat in Wii Ghostbusters is tedious and unsatisfying. Don’t get me wrong, it feels great to tear up the environment with an IR sensor-controlled proton pack, and moderately satisfying to throw out a trap by holding down the Z button and swinging your arm forward. The main problem is that the simple process of bustin’ a ghost is nowhere near as compelling or well-paced as it is in the other versions of the game. After doing enough damage to an apparition with the proton pack, the ghost can be wrangled. In the 360 version, this means you can either start pressing the L trigger to slam him into walls and floors at your leisure until you feel like dragging him into the trap.
In the Wii version, this means you have to play through a poorly paced, barely interactive game of simon says. A big red arrow appears on the ghost telling you to slam him to the right, so you flick your Wiimote to the right. Then, a short pause. Another red arrow shows up telling you to slam him in another direction, and if you don’t move the Wiimote in the correct way then nothing happens and the damage isn’t done. After you’ve finally whittled the ghost’s health down, you simply move it near the trap to automatically capture it. There’s no satisfying struggle to keep the ghost within the cone of light emanating from the trap as he slowly descends into it, like you get in the 360 version — he just runs into the trap and disappears.
After a few hours of bustin’, I began to lament the sight of each new ghost. Having to wait for the game to tell me when I was allowed to slam a ghost felt so clunky and uninvolving that at one point, I actually groaned aloud when four ghosts sprang up out of nowhere. While some of the Wii levels are unquestionably better than the 360 ones — the Ghostworld boss is way better, and I actually exclaimed, “that’s awesome!” upon seeing the Wii version’s interpretation of the Spider Woman’s lair — a game called Ghostbusters should not, ideally, make me dread the actual act of busting ghosts.

The co-op in Ghostbusters Wii is much more satisfying than the online play available on the other versions. Davis and I constantly crossed our streams for fun (try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light), and I took frequent sadistic pleasure in slowing her down with the slime gun whenever possible. Where multiplayer is concerned, both games are missing something that feels downright necessary; it’s up to you whether you value a local cooperative campaign more than online, plot-free multiplayer.
If it weren’t for the unfortunate bustin’ mechanics, I would find it impossible to determine if Ghostbusters for the Wii was better or worse than the other, prettier versions that have been offered. The Wii version utilizes the alternate weapons in a more imaginative, consistent, and puzzle-centric way. It includes a fair amount of new, funny dialogue and one or two levels that irrefutably trump their 360 counterparts. In the end, though, the immensely satisfying act of wrangling a ghost into submission — that one gameplay mechanic the 360 and PS3 versions absolutely nailed — has been replaced with a tedious and disappointing Simon Says minigame repeated ad infinitum throughout the game’s five hour running time.

It’s just a shame that, where the Wii version is concerned, bustin’ didn’t make me feel good.
I swear to God, I won’t say that again for another six months.
Score: 5.5 
Final score:  5.75 — Mediocre (5s are an exercise in apathy, neither Solid nor Liquid. Not exactly bad, but not very good either. Just a bit “meh,” really.)

<h2>The long road ahead</h2>

<h2>And I agree with him</h2>
<p>Some version of a real life, widespread virtual reality world has been an aspiration of sci-fi enthusiasts for decades, and as technology has improved in recent years, that dream has become closer than ever before. Meta (formerly Facebook) and Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse project have been the closest mainstream attempt we’ve seen, but if that’s the best we have, it’ll be a while until we see a VR world akin to something out of <em>Ready Player One</em>. The internet has taken the opportunity to roast pretty much everything the Metaverse has shown because, well, it looks ridiculous. Take their most recent announcement about adding legs, for example, which apparently <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-metaverse-legs-motion-capture-animation-2022-10"">don’t even work how they said they do</a>.</p>
<p>One of gaming’s most influential voices, head of Xbox Phil Spencer, recently shared his opinion during <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/wsj-tech-live-2022"">WSJ Live</a>, as reported by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren"">Tom Warren</a> of <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.theverge.com/"">The Verge</a>. When asked about his thoughts on the Metaverse as we know it right now, Spencer said that “today it’s a poorly built video game.

<h2>The “winter” window has been narrowed down</h2>
<p>Several months ago, Nintendo teased a trio of <em>Splatoon 3</em> amiibo (Octoling Blue, Inkling Yellow, and Smallfry) arriving “this holiday.” Well <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/splatoon-3-amiibo-are-coming-this-holiday/"">thanks to a new YouTube video</a>, the release date has been narrowed down to November 11.</p>
<p>Roughly the first minute of the video is a recap <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/here-is-what-all-the-amiibo-unlock-in-splatoon-3/"">of everything we covered here</a>: including basic amiibo functionality. But in the remaining 20 seconds or so there’s a release date announcement, plus a brief look at what costumes the upcoming amiibo will grant players. Reprints of several old <em>Splatoon</em> amiibo (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://cpsia.nintendo.com/107615/107615.pdf"">including Pearl and Marina</a>) are coming around the same time, so keep an eye out for those as well.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that as of late, amiibo haven’t been as super rare as they have been in the past. While old school amiibo hunters are always ready for an instant-sell-out situation, stock has generally been plentiful: so hopefully that will be the case for these figures too.</p>
<p>Once these three are released in November, we’ll have the following announced amiibo remaining:</p>

The “winter” window has been narrowed down
Several months ago, Nintendo teased a trio of Splatoon 3 amiibo (Octoling Blue, Inkling Yellow, and Smallfry) arriving “this holiday.” Well thanks to a new YouTube video, the release date has been narrowed down to November 11.
Roughly the first minute of the video is a recap of everything we covered here: including basic amiibo functionality. But in the remaining 20 seconds or so there’s a release date announcement, plus a brief look at what costumes the upcoming amiibo will grant players. Reprints of several old Splatoon amiibo (including Pearl and Marina) are coming around the same time, so keep an eye out for those as well.
Keep in mind that as of late, amiibo haven’t been as super rare as they have been in the past. While old school amiibo hunters are always ready for an instant-sell-out situation, stock has generally been plentiful: so hopefully that will be the case for these figures too.
Once these three are released in November, we’ll have the following announced amiibo remaining:

<h2>The slimy indie hit returns</h2>
<p>Lots of great indie games have been getting a lot of love this year — <em>Stray</em> was Annapurna’s biggest launch by far, and <em>Cult of the Lamb </em>had <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/cult-of-the-lamb-hits-over-a-million-players-in-only-a-week/"" target=""_blank"">over a million players in a week</a>. Now it looks like <em>Slime Rancher 2</em> is joining those ranks, because it has reached a big milestone of over 100,000 copies within the first six hours of its release. Nick Popovich, co-founder and CEO of the studio behind the <em>Slime Rancher </em>series Monomi Park, shared a tweet yesterday thanking fans for making the game a success.</p>
<p>For those who may not be familiar, the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-slime-rancher/"">first </a><em><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-slime-rancher/"" target=""_blank"">Slime Rancher</a> </em>game came out back in 2017 after about a year of being in early access. In the game, players take on the role of a farmer tasked with collecting and breeding different types of slimes on their very own ranch, all wrapped up in an open-world FPS-style packaging. Critical reception to <em>Slime Rancher</em> was favorable, but over the years it garnered something of a cult following, and got PlayStation and Switch releases years after its initial launch for PC and Xbox.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had a pipe dream in my head that we could sell 100k copies of Slime Rancher 2 in the first 24 hrs if the stars aligned. And we did that in less than 6 hrs. No idea where this crazy train is headed but so grateful to have a chance to ride it.

<p>Anecdotally, I’ve seen love for the <em>Slime Rancher</em> series spread through word of mouth more than anything — it’s another one of those <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/how-stardew-valley-ushered-in-farming-simulators-renaissance/"" target=""_blank"">cozy farming-style games</a> that players just can’t seem to get enough of.

<p>100,000 may seem like a relatively small number compared to some huge launches that can be in the millions, but for an indie studio, that can be life-changing.

<p>According to a <a href=""https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23865964/"" target=""_blank"">new blog post</a>, Blizzard is continuing to roll out more stability updates, and is continuing to monitor the game.

<h2>Not Perfect</h2>
<p>Some lucky <em>Street Fighter</em> fans got a sneaky treat this week, as the recent <em>Street Fighter 6 Closed Beta</em> miraculously <a href=""https://twitter.com/Rooflemonger/status/1584980219626409985?s=20&amp;t=nkWle_HZuIWFMoWCtCQPZg"" target=""_blank"">sprang back to life for several hours</a>, before quietly shutting down once again.

<p>Of course, this reopening of the servers was a total accident. Players were noting that the unofficial beta was crashing, load times had been extended, and online matches were disconnecting with regularity. So clearly, somewhere, somebody at Capcom typed a “1” where a “0” was needed and opened the door to the PS5 community. It is incredibly likely that the publisher which launch more betas before<em> Street Fighter 6</em>‘s eventual 2023 release, and there will assuredly be an open beta at some point to stress test the servers, (though it must be said that online was very slick during the official beta run time.)</p>
<p>While I certainly don’t wanna be a cop about things. Word of various accidental betas and cracks is a little frustrating for players. Getting started in a fighting game is tough enough, let alone when some cabals of players have already been putting in hours, weeks, or even months of additional, unofficial practice. The larger concern is that unofficial access will scare publishers away from further beta periods — though, in the long run, these off-record throwdowns are unlikely to affect launch sales.</p>

<h2>From September 18 to October 1, 2022</h2>
<p>If you want to get in on a shiny Eternatus <em>Pokemon Sword</em> and <em>Shield</em> event, you’ll have to go to an actual store in the near future.</p>
<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/psa-europe-has-a-pokemon-distribution-event-going-on-right-now/"">Following a tease that it would be happening in some regions</a>, information on the distribution event i<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/receive-shiny-eternatus-at-gamestop-or-eb-games"">s fully live now on the official Pokemon site</a>.</p>
<h2>All the details on the Pokemon shiny Eternatus distribution:</h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s located at <strong>GameStop</strong> (in the US and Canada) or <strong>EB Games</strong> (in Australia and New Zealand)</li>
<li>As per usual you don’t need to buy anything, and <strong>the code will be distributed by way of a card</strong></li>
<li>The event runs from <strong>September 18 through October 1</strong></li>
<li>The Eternatus you’ll get from the event is <strong>level 100</strong>, with timid nature and the pressure ability (move-wise it sports dynamax cannon, eternabeam, sludge bomb, and flamethrower)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nintendo also provides re-iterated instructions on mystery gift redemption:</h2>
<p>To claim your in-game gift, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch your <em>Pokémon Sword</em> or <em>Pokémon Shield</em></li>
<li>Select <strong>Mystery Gift </strong>on the X menu.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Get a Mystery Gift</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Get with Code/Password </strong>to save your game and connect to the internet.</li>
<li>Enter your code or password.</li>
<li>Watch as the gift arrives in your game. (Pokémon will appear in your party or your Pokémon Boxes. Items will appear in your Bag.)</li>
<li>Be sure to save your game.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall it’s a pretty simple process: <strong>other than going to the store</strong>! At least this event is for a shiny legendary, and not a quirky character from the anime.</p>
<p>[<strong>Update: </strong><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/EBGamesAus/status/1571684711059038211"">EB Games Australia has clarified</a> that the offer will be available in the region, albeit in “early October.”]</p>

If you want to get in on a shiny Eternatus Pokemon Sword and Shield event, you’ll have to go to an actual store in the near future.
Following a tease that it would be happening in some regions, information on the distribution event is fully live now on the official Pokemon site.
All the details on the Pokemon shiny Eternatus distribution:

It’s located at GameStop (in the US and Canada) or EB Games (in Australia and New Zealand)
As per usual you don’t need to buy anything, and the code will be distributed by way of a card
The event runs from September 18 through October 1
The Eternatus you’ll get from the event is level 100, with timid nature and the pressure ability (move-wise it sports dynamax cannon, eternabeam, sludge bomb, and flamethrower)

Nintendo also provides re-iterated instructions on mystery gift redemption:
To claim your in-game gift, follow these steps:

Launch your Pokémon Sword or Pokémon Shield
Select Mystery Gift on the X menu.
Select Get a Mystery Gift.
Select Get with Code/Password to save your game and connect to the internet.
Enter your code or password.
Watch as the gift arrives in your game. (Pokémon will appear in your party or your Pokémon Boxes. Items will appear in your Bag.)
Be sure to save your game.

Overall it’s a pretty simple process: other than going to the store! At least this event is for a shiny legendary, and not a quirky character from the anime.
[Update: EB Games Australia has clarified that the offer will be available in the region, albeit in “early October.”]

<h2>Say Cheese</h2>
<p>During today’s <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/recap-everything-that-happened-at-the-packed-september-2022-nintendo-direct/"" target=""_blank"">Nintendo Direct</a> presentation, Koei Tecmo announced that a remaster of 2008 Wii horror title <em>Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse </em>is coming to Nintendo Switch — alongside PlayStation, Xbox, and PC ports — in early 2023.</p>
<p>This release will see the title, the <a href=""https://fatalframe.fandom.com/wiki/Fatal_Frame_IV:_Mask_of_the_Lunar_Eclipse"" target=""_blank"">fourth installment</a> in the <em>Fatal Frame</em> franchise, receive its first official western release and once again sees a luckless hero traipse through a terrifying haunted house and battle an army of ghosts and demons, armed with the mythical Camera Obscura.</p>
<p>This remaster includes “an all-new Photo Mode, along with new and altered costumes, and enhanced graphics including the improved rendering of shadows and light,” according to Koei Tecmo. “In addition, in-game movies and character models have been brushed-up to deliver a story that shines, both narratively and aesthetically as the three remaining girls attempt to rediscover their past before becoming victims once again.”</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

During today’s Nintendo Direct presentation, Koei Tecmo announced that a remaster of 2008 Wii horror title Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse is coming to Nintendo Switch — alongside PlayStation, Xbox, and PC ports — in early 2023.

<h2>It’s going to be a busy year for gaming</h2>
<p>Even as Sony shares <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/playstation-ps-vr-2-first-look-headset-design-sony/"" target=""_blank"">more details</a> about PlayStation VR2, we’ve still wondered about the games, the timing, and crucially, the price. Today, the company narrowed in a bit — PlayStation VR2 is officially coming in “early 2023,” according to a tweet from PlayStation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coming early 2023. <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/PSVR2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#PSVR2</a> <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://t.co/R3MwWVPyNt"">pic.twitter.com/R3MwWVPyNt</a></p>

<p>It’s a simple announcement tweet with just the new timeline and a familiar photo of the PS5 headset and VR2 Sense controllers, both of which have been <a href=""https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-vr2/"" target=""_blank"">shown off before</a>. With Gamescom happening this week, this could be a lead-in for a wider announcement. Or it could just be another incremental news update, business as usual. You never know.</p>
<h2>How much is too much?</h2>
<p>I’m anxious about the price, particularly after Meta Quest 2 got <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/meta-quest-2-virtual-reality-price-hike-headset-oculus-facebook/"" target=""_blank"">a $100 price hike</a>.</p>
<p>The $400 range would be a pleasant surprise, but I’m expecting closer to $500 (depending on what’s included). Either way, if you’re a new PS5 owner, it’ll likely be a lot. I’m saving.</p>
<p>That said, I got my money’s worth out of the PlayStation VR, and it’s been long enough that I’m ready to invest in another VR platform. Even with technical drawbacks, I liked the PSVR experience — I’m expecting to feel the same way about PSVR2. In some ways, I hope the next headset echoes the PS4-to-PS5 transition; more of the same, but nicer.</p>
<figure><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Resident-Evil-Village-PlayStation-VR2-screenshot.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""Resident Evil Village VR"" /><figcaption><sub>Dual wielding in <em>Resident Evil Village</em> VR.</sub></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sony has plenty of time to do a big VR-focused State of Play blowout stream in the coming months. For now, the docket has <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em>, <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, and <em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners – Chapter 2: Retribution</em>.</p>
<p>PlayStation VR garnered fans, and I’m crossing my fingers that PSVR2 is the upgrade it should be. An ergonomic, well-thought-out headset is nothing without meaningful games, and expectations are only getting higher. <em>Resident Evil</em> gets my <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/resident-evil-4-remake-announced-march-2023-release-date-support-playstation-vr2/"" target=""_blank"">foot in the door</a>, at least.</p>
<p>The <em>Resident Evil 4</em> remake is out on March 23, 2023, and it’ll support PlayStation VR2 in some not-yet-concrete way. I’m also down for <a href=""https://blog.playstation.com/2022/06/02/resident-evil-village-is-coming-to-psvr2/"" target=""_blank"">another</a> <em>Village</em> run.</p>
<p>It’s fun to think back to the PSVR launch lineup — it was a <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/heres-a-recap-of-our-playstation-vr-launch-coverage/"" target=""_blank"">mad dash</a> around here with Chris and I splitting up review duties for games like <em>SuperHyperCube</em>, <em>Until Dawn: Rush of Blood</em>, <em>Rez Infinite</em>, <em>Job Simulator</em>, and <em>Batman: Arkham VR</em>. I’m hoping for a splashy group.</p>

<h2>The studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal has reportedly been closed</h2>
<p>It looks like Embracer Group is shuttering one of its recent acquisitions. Onoma, <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/onoma-square-enix-montreal-rebrand-embracer-group/"" target=""_blank"">formerly known as Square Enix Montreal</a> before its Embracer acquisition, has reportedly been shut down.</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-01/embracer-group-shuts-down-montreal-video-game-studio"" target=""_blank"">new Bloomberg report</a> says that, according to sources familiar with the situation, the Montreal-based studio will see some staff move to sister-studio Eidos Montreal. Employees were reportedly informed of the move today.</p>
<p>There’s also more to the move. Bloomberg reports that Eidos Montreal has reduced the scope of one unannounced project and will cancel another. The company also plans to work with Microsoft to develop some games, including a <em>Fable </em>title, according to Bloomberg’s info.</p>
<p>In a <a href=""https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1587515910046220288"" target=""_blank"">follow-up on Twitter</a>, Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier says Eidos Montreal canceled a rumored “kids on bikes” game inspired by <em>Stranger Things</em>. According to Schreier, Eidos Montreal is now currently working on a new IP (which was rescoped) and a new <em>Deus Ex </em>game. That’s alongside the aforementioned Xbox collaboration.</p>

<h2>Goodbye, <em>GO</em></h2>
<p>In a statement via <a href=""https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-closing-former-square-enix-montreal-studio-and-qa-team"" target=""_blank"">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, CDE Entertainment—the Embracer-owned business group containing the assets acquired from Square Enix—confirms the move. The group is also closing its publishing QA team. The company says it will try to match some of those affected to open positions within projects at the rest of the company.</p>
<p>“We see the growth opportunities centered around our premier franchises and AAA games,” said CDE director Phil Rogers via GIbiz. “Closing publishing QA and our Onoma studio is a difficult decision and one that we’ve taken with great care and consideration. We greatly thank all those team members for their contributions over the years and hope to find proper placements for as many as possible.”</p>
<p>The move is especially surprising, as Onoma was <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/onoma-square-enix-montreal-rebrand-embracer-group/"" target=""_blank"">recently renamed</a> and re-branded following its Embracer acquisition. The massive publisher group picked up Square Enix Montreal, alongside Eidos Montreal and Crystal Dynamics, in <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/embracer-group-acquires-crystal-dynamics-square-enix-montreal-eidos-deal/"" target=""_blank"">one big acquisition</a>. The deal was <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/embracer-group-closes-deal-crystal-dynamics-square-enix-montreal-eidos/"" target=""_blank"">finalized in August</a>.</p>
<p>Onoma, or Square Enix Montreal, was best known for its <em>GO </em>series, including <em><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-hitman-go/"" target=""_blank"">Hitman GO</a> </em>and <em>Lara Croft GO</em>.</p>

		<h2>PC port joins console editions</h2>
<p>Good news for PC shmuppers today, as City Connection <a href=""https://twitter.com/claricedisc/status/1583666682303635456?s=20&amp;t=bWibaHxGQ3WU3ZntQ5m5XA"" target=""_blank"">has announced</a> that Cave shmup <em>Akai Katana Shin</em> will be arriving on Steam on December 15, in alignment with its previously announced re-release on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/caves-akai-katana-shin-is-getting-a-re-release-in-december/"" target=""_blank"">As we have previously reported</a>, <em>Akai Katana Shin</em> originally launched on Xbox 360 in 2011, itself a remaster of Cave’s great 2010 arcade release. In typical Cave fashion the dazzling shmup features adrenaline-pumping, bullet-hell action, a beat-heavy soundtrack, and a melodramatic storyline that features a put-upon people, sick of being sacrificed to the titular totem, rising up against their oppressors in a bid for freedom.</p>
<p>Check out a preview of the re-release from April’s FES 2022 stream. The action starts at 33:30.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/yNZTTM3sZG4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>The new release will feature high-resolution visuals, a widescreen presentation format, and three individual modes to please both <em>Akai Katana</em> veterans and newcomers. <em>Akai Katana Origin</em> will replicate the 2010 arcade in all of its 4:3 glory, <em>Akai Katana Slash </em>will feature revised enemy patterns, new mechanics, and the aforementioned 16:9 screen ratio, while <em>Akai Katana Climax </em>will feature a blend of the previous modes, readjusted for balance. City Connection has noted that <em>Akai Katana Shin</em> will support multiple languages, including English, French, and Spanish.</p>
<p><em>Akai Katana Shin</em> launches December 15 on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. A physical release will follow in 2023 on PS4 and Nintendo Switch only.</p>

The studio formerly known as Square Enix Montreal has reportedly been closed
It looks like Embracer Group is shuttering one of its recent acquisitions. Onoma, formerly known as Square Enix Montreal before its Embracer acquisition, has reportedly been shut down.
A new Bloomberg report says that, according to sources familiar with the situation, the Montreal-based studio will see some staff move to sister-studio Eidos Montreal. Employees were reportedly informed of the move today.
There’s also more to the move. Bloomberg reports that Eidos Montreal has reduced the scope of one unannounced project and will cancel another. The company also plans to work with Microsoft to develop some games, including a Fable title, according to Bloomberg’s info.

According to Schreier, Eidos Montreal is now currently working on a new IP (which was rescoped) and a new Deus Ex game. That’s alongside the aforementioned Xbox collaboration.

Goodbye, GO
In a statement via GamesIndustry.biz, CDE Entertainment—the Embracer-owned business group containing the assets acquired from Square Enix—confirms the move. The group is also closing its publishing QA team. The company says it will try to match some of those affected to open positions within projects at the rest of the company.

The move is especially surprising, as Onoma was recently renamed and re-branded following its Embracer acquisition. The massive publisher group picked up Square Enix Montreal, alongside Eidos Montreal and Crystal Dynamics, in one big acquisition. The deal was finalized in August.

Good news for PC shmuppers today, as City Connection has announced that Cave shmup Akai Katana Shin will be arriving on Steam on December 15, in alignment with its previously announced re-release on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.
As we have previously reported, Akai Katana Shin originally launched on Xbox 360 in 2011, itself a remaster of Cave’s great 2010 arcade release. In typical Cave fashion the dazzling shmup features adrenaline-pumping, bullet-hell action, a beat-heavy soundtrack, and a melodramatic storyline that features a put-upon people, sick of being sacrificed to the titular totem, rising up against their oppressors in a bid for freedom.
Check out a preview of the re-release from April’s FES 2022 stream. The action starts at 33:30.

The new release will feature high-resolution visuals, a widescreen presentation format, and three individual modes to please both Akai Katana veterans and newcomers. Akai Katana Origin will replicate the 2010 arcade in all of its 4:3 glory, Akai Katana Slash will feature revised enemy patterns, new mechanics, and the aforementioned 16:9 screen ratio, while Akai Katana Climax will feature a blend of the previous modes, readjusted for balance. City Connection has noted that Akai Katana Shin will support multiple languages, including English, French, and Spanish.
Akai Katana Shin launches December 15 on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. A physical release will follow in 2023 on PS4 and Nintendo Switch only.

<p>In what might be perhaps the single most niche emporium ever established, Japan will be getting a <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/pokemon-center-london-august-2022-world-championships/"" target=""_blank"">“pop-up shop”</a> entirely devoted to the cult franchise <em>Clock Tower.</em> Situated in “The Akihabara Container” in Tokyo, the store will offer up a variety of exclusive goodies pertaining to the Gothic survival horror series.</p>
<p>The <em>Clock Tower</em> faithful can visit the location from November 3, rolling out fistfuls of Yen in order to bag merchandise based upon the original <em>Clock Tower</em> (1995) and its sequel <em>Clock Tower 2: The Struggle Within</em> (1998). Up for grabs will be mugs, keychains, wall scrolls, clothing apparel, standees, posters, and more, with the piece de resistance being an old-school alarm clock that plays the game’s title theme!</p>
<p>Check out the goodies in the flyer below, <a href=""https://www.famitsu.com/news/202210/31281065.html"" target=""_blank"">courtesy of Famitsu</a> and <a href=""https://www.siliconera.com/clock-tower-pop-up-shop-to-appear-in-november/"" target=""_blank"">Siliconera.</a></p>

<p>The <em>Clock Tower</em> series combines classic point-and-click gameplay with the survival horror tropes of the mid-’90s, as protagonists pick their way through creepy locations in an effort to stay one step ahead of the terrifying killer “Scissorman”. Inspired by Dario Argento’s bug-filled 1985 flick, <em>Phenomena</em>, the<em> Clock Tower</em> games are praised for their mood, classic visuals, and unnerving atmosphere, but the series as a whole has always been hampered by slow, and in some cases archaic, gameplay mechanics. Regardless, they have found their own dedicated following — as all horror franchises tend to do.</p>
<p>Regardless, it’s incredibly quirky to see an entire store devoted to its presence, and I’m sure fans will make sure they grab a hold of as many goodies as possible before the doors close for good at the end of the month.

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

<h2>Kemonomimi Master Race</h2>
<p>Its title might be a bit of a mouthful to pronounce, but <em>Utawarerumono </em>is a good time. I’ve sung its praises over the years, and despite some missteps, I’d recommend the core series wholeheartedly…bar one problem: The original story is only available in English as a mediocre TV series adaptation. Atlus localized the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/review-utawarerumono-mask-of-deception-434736.phtml"">two</a>–<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/review-utawarerumono-mask-of-truth-457050.phtml"">part</a> sequel for PS4 a couple of years back as <em>Utawarerumono: Mask of Deception</em> and <em>Mask of Truth</em>, but the 2002 original was too old and janky to make for a viable port, leaving it Japan-exclusive but for some technically illegal fan translation patches.</p>
<p>Thankfully, developer Aquaplus opted to remaster the original recently as <em>Utawarerumono: Prelude to the Fallen</em>. An English version is on its way to PS4 this year courtesy of NIS America (who also published the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/review-utawarerumono-zan-566871.phtml""><em>Utawarerumono: ZAN</em> </a>spinoff).  </p>
<p>Which brings us to the even better news: All three games will be getting PC ports from ShiraVN (a team based at <em>Kantai Collection</em> publisher DMM games), starting with <em>Mask of Deception </em>and <em>Mask of Truth </em>debuting on Steam this January 23. <em>Prelude to the Fallen</em> is “planned” for PC this year, presumably coming sometime after NISA brings out the console edition. ShiraVN promises that the PC editions will preserve the localization and translation work from the existing console editions, which is reassuring considering poor translation is a common complaint of Steam users perusing the store’s “foreign language” offerings. </p>
<p>All in all, good news for all three existing <i>Utawarerumono</i> fans (hi!). If you’re new to the franchise and want to see what all the fuss is about, I’d actually recommend holding out for <em>Prelude to the Fallen</em> if you can stand to wait for it. <em>Mask of Deception</em> works decently as an entry point, but by necessity it spoils some background details that will blunt some key points in <em>Prelude to the Fallen</em>‘s story. </p>

<h2>We get a look at more farming, socializing, and one of the town’s residents</h2>
<p>Square Enix is sharing some more info about its slice-of-life farming RPG <em>Harvestella </em>today. A <a href=""https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/fresh-look-harvestella"" target=""_blank"">new blog highlights</a> one of the locals, some of the in-game activities, and the very hometown itself of Nemea.</p>
<p>Nemea is the town in which <em>Harvestella </em>takes place, and life there is governed by five seasons. While we’re familiar with autumn, winter, spring, and summer, Nemea’s fifth season is a bit more dangerous. Quietus arrives between each season, and it carries a deadly dust that keeps residents indoors and destroys crops.</p>
<p>So clearly, figuring out what’s up with Quietus is a sizable preoccupation for the player. But in today’s Square Enix blog, we get a bunch of looks at Nemea, a gorgeous town with flowers constantly in bloom.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Harvestella_NemeaDay_080322.jpeg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" alt /></p>
<h2>Much to do around town</h2>

<p>Getting to know the residents of Nemea will be pretty important, it seems, as they’ll also be your gateway to new classes.

<p>Recruiting a character who has a certain job will unlock it for the protagonist, according to today’s update.

<p>And on top of the farming and fishing, there’s also some industry to be set up.

We get a look at more farming, socializing, and one of the town’s residents
Square Enix is sharing some more info about its slice-of-life farming RPG Harvestella today. A new blog highlights one of the locals, some of the in-game activities, and the very hometown itself of Nemea.
Nemea is the town in which Harvestella takes place, and life there is governed by five seasons. While we’re familiar with autumn, winter, spring, and summer, Nemea’s fifth season is a bit more dangerous. Quietus arrives between each season, and it carries a deadly dust that keeps residents indoors and destroys crops.
So clearly, figuring out what’s up with Quietus is a sizable preoccupation for the player. But in today’s Square Enix blog, we get a bunch of looks at Nemea, a gorgeous town with flowers constantly in bloom.

Much to do around town
The residents of Nemea also seem like they’ll be helping the player out on their quest. One new character introduced today is Istina, a teacher who runs the town’s orphanage. She only arrived in Nemea a few years prior to the game’s events, but has quickly ingratiated herself as the quiet intellectual who reads aloud to the children.

<h2>A flood of cozy simulators in the wake of <em>Stardew</em>‘s success</h2>
<p>It feels like with every new batch of gaming news streams we get, they’re accompanied by memes about whichever game genre dominates the announcements and updates. Over the summer, there was an endless stream of dark space marine shooters, and after the news streams that rolled through this week, it seems there’s a new genre <a href=""https://www.polygon.com/23351439/nintendo-direct-farm-rpg-simulator-harvestella-story-of-seasons"" target=""_blank"">taking over the industry</a> for the next few months: farming simulators.</p>
<p><i>Ooblets</i>, <i>I Am Future</i>, <i>Dreamlight Valley, Potion Permit, Bear and Breakfast, Witchbrook, My Time at Portia, Wytchwood, Homestead Arcana, Little Witch in the Woods, Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life — </i>the list of upcoming or newly released farming/community sims never-ending these days. This is excellent news for me, considering it’s one of my favorite genres ever, and you can bet your bottom dollar I’m playing as many of them as I can.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ooblet-run.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" alt /></p>
<h3>Why was <em>Stardew</em> so popular?</h3>
<p>While farming/community sims have been around for a long, long time, I think we can accredit a lot of their recent resurgence to the success of one stellar indie game: <i>Stardew Valley</i>. It’s one of those games that’s simple enough to pick up and start playing regardless of your skill level and even regardless of where you are in any given save file, yet still complex enough for players to challenge themselves and min-max the crap out of it if they want to.</p>
<p>The controls are simple and you can run it on anything, which means it’s available (as well as affordably priced) on every conceivable platform. The game has fostered a <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stardew-valley-mods-list-make-the-game-feel-fresh-again/"" target=""_blank"">rich modding community</a>, who enjoy putting a fresh spin on the gameplay, story, characters, aesthetics, and so on.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s the passion project of a single developer, and has all of the charm and care you might expect from someone who truly loves what they’re making. All of these elements came together to not just create an unforgettable game, but a full-on cultural phenomenon that swept through the industry and made <i>Stardew</i> one of the most beloved and successful indie games of all time.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Stardew-Valley-mods-screenshot.jpg?resize=640%2C406&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""Stardew Valley update 1.6 will help modders"" /></p>
<h3>Cause and effect</h3>
<p>If my hypothesis is correct, that means that now over six years after its release, we are seeing <i>Stardew Valley</i>’s influence ripple through the industry — hence the wave of cozy farming/community simulators. Of course, we have to give credit where it’s due to series like <i>Animal Crossing</i> and <i>Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons </i>for paving the way for this once niche genre to break further into the mainstream, but I truly believe <i>Stardew</i> is what pushed it over the edge due to its universal appeal and subsequent popularity.</p>
<p>So now we have a wave of all kinds of games that are putting their own spin on the classic farming/community sim formula, which is a ton of fun to see. Just like shooters or RPGs take the mechanical motifs of their genre and try to do something no one has quite seen before down to the most minute level, simulators are seeing the same level of impassioned scrutiny.</p>
<p>Video games are still an incredibly young medium compared to film, television, literature, or even their older cousin, tabletop games. As someone who has studied patterns and whole movements that form in media, I can’t express how cool it is to see developers explore the intricacies of a newer genre and create something new.</p>

<h3>Carving a new path</h3>
<p>So for example, most of these games are going to have mechanics like farming, mining, fishing, cooking, crafting, befriending townspeople, etc., but the combination in how these mechanics are implemented and influence each other will always be unique. Each game will have different economic and social systems for the player to interact with that will lead to different outcomes.</p>
<p>It’s like how a lot of games like <i>BioShock</i>, <i>Mass Effect</i>, and <i>Dishonored</i>, for example, have some kind of magic mechanic to supplement weapons that we know and recognize, like guns, daggers, etc. While we’re familiar with the motif of magic supplementing familiar weapons, each game that implements its own kind of magic will use that magic slightly differently — what the magic can do will be different, the cost of that magic will be different (usually utilizing some kind of mana system, which can also have an infinite number of variations), and so on. There are a lot of layers here.</p>

<p>My point is, we have enough farming simulators now that by nature of a saturated (and nearly oversaturated) market, developers are forced to think creatively when it comes to using the mechanics in the toolbox of their genre to create as engaging of an experience as possible.</p>
<p>Then we get games like <i>Cult of the Lamb</i> or <i>Ooblets</i>, which combine community simulation with an action roguelike and farming simulation with <em>Pokémon</em>-style animal companion battling, respectively. Like storytelling, the key to making fresh and exciting games is finding new ways to combine and implement elements we already love.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to study that phenomenon in retrospect, but it’s another to see it happen in real time. Regardless of what some people say, I think this is a very, very exciting time for games — especially farming simulators.</p>

<h2>Geralt of Rivia is dead. Long live Geralt of Rivia</h2>
<p>If you’ve been on social media at all in the past few days or managed to make it through the entirety of <em>Black Adam</em>, you’ve probably heard that Henry Cavill is once again suiting up as the Man of Steel. Whether or not his return to the DC Extended Universe will finally help Warner Bros. get that disaster train back on track remains to be seen. What we do know is that Cavill will be walking away from the role that’s kept him busy in the years since he had to have his mustache digitally removed in post-production. It was announced today that <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth"" target=""_blank"">Cavill is stepping down as Geralt of Rivia</a> in the hit Netflix adaptation of <em>The Witcher</em>.</p>

<p>As you can see in the tweet above, Cavill will be replaced in season 4 by Robert California Liam Hemsworth. The second-tier Hemsworth is probably best known for his role as Gale Hawthrone in the <em>Hunger Games</em> films and, like many of his fellow Aussies, a brief stint on the soap opera <em>Neighbours</em>. He also did a show for Quibi. Raise your hand if you remember Quibi.</p>
<p>While Cavill is leaving the Netflix series behind, fans will still be able to see him as Geralt when <em>The Witcher</em>‘s <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/the-witcher-season-3-is-in-production-plot-summary-netflix-news/"" target=""_blank"">third season debuts sometime next year</a>.

<h2>Xbox’s Phil Spencer is making ‘ongoing proactive adjustments’</h2>
<p>Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox at Microsoft, has responded to this week’s report on Activision Blizzard and its CEO, Bobby Kotick. A <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/xbox-chief-says-he-s-evaluating-relationship-with-activision?sref=ExbtjcSG"" target=""_blank"">new Bloomberg report</a> says that Spencer is “evaluating all aspects” of their relationship with Activision Blizzard and “making ongoing proactive adjustments.”</p>
<p>An email sent to staff and seen by Bloomberg said Spencer and his gaming leadership team are “disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions” at the video game publisher. It’s similar to another statement obtained by Bloomberg from <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/playstation-chief-criticizes-activision-response-to-allegations"" target=""_blank"">PlayStation chief Jim Ryan</a>, although it sounds like Spencer is also discussing possible actions Xbox could take in its relationship with Activision Blizzard.</p>
<p>“This type of behavior has no place in our industry,” said Spencer.</p>
<p>An Activision Blizzard spokesperson <a href=""https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1461425277335220226"" target=""_blank"">provided a response to Bloomberg</a>, saying the company “respects all feedback from our valued partners ” and that it is “committed to the work of ensuring our culture and workplace are safe, diverse, and inclusive.”</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-phil-spencer-evaluating-activision-relationship-deeply-troubled"" target=""_blank"">IGN</a> reached out to Spencer to verify the report, and received an additional comment from the Xbox head:</p>

Xbox’s Phil Spencer is making ‘ongoing proactive adjustments’
Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox at Microsoft, has responded to this week’s report on Activision Blizzard and its CEO, Bobby Kotick. A new Bloomberg report says that Spencer is “evaluating all aspects” of their relationship with Activision Blizzard and “making ongoing proactive adjustments.”
An email sent to staff and seen by Bloomberg said Spencer and his gaming leadership team are “disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions” at the video game publisher. It’s similar to another statement obtained by Bloomberg from PlayStation chief Jim Ryan, although it sounds like Spencer is also discussing possible actions Xbox could take in its relationship with Activision Blizzard.
“This type of behavior has no place in our industry,” said Spencer.
An Activision Blizzard spokesperson provided a response to Bloomberg, saying the company “respects all feedback from our valued partners ” and that it is “committed to the work of ensuring our culture and workplace are safe, diverse, and inclusive.”
IGN reached out to Spencer to verify the report, and received an additional comment from the Xbox head:
“I personally have strong values for a welcoming and inclusive environment for all of our employees at Xbox. This is not a destination but a journey that we will always be on. The leadership at Xbox and Microsoft stand by our teams and support them in building a safer environment for all.”
Spencer reportedly referred to the Wall Street Journal report filed earlier this week, alleging that Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick was aware of sexual misconduct at the company for years. While the Board of Directors has issued a statement saying they remain confident in Kotick’s leadership, others have called for the removal of Kotick as CEO, including a shareholder group and a number of Activision Blizzard employees.
Today, hundreds of Activision Blizzard employees signed an open petition calling for the removal of Kotick. Activision Blizzard workers also staged a walkout earlier this week over the report. And all of this arrives after a lawsuit filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, alleging harassment, discrimination, and a toxic workplace culture at the company.

<p>Something<em> very</em> special from the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster takes time out from its recent Namco obsession to deliver not only a Tecmo title, but a fun, silly, and particularly obscure one at that — Available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch its forgotten fighter <em>Angel Eyes!</em></p>
<p>Released to Japanese arcades in 1996, <em>Angel Eyes</em> — or to give it its full title<em> Tōkidenshō Angel Eyes</em> — is a super cult 2D fighter that was renowned for sporting an All Anime Gal cast of scrappers. A selection of fun character tropes, including a school girl, a volleyball player, a kunoichi, an arrogant “ojou” woman, and a young girl with a giant teddy bear (<a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dnf-duel-enchantress-trailer-nexon-fighting-games-arcsys/"" target=""_blank"">predating Enchantress by several decades</a>), fight it out in cute ‘n’ colorful action, set against the backdrop of some equally strange locations, such as a fun fair, and a medieval castle!</p>
<p>Check out the cute ‘n’ crazy carnage in the video below, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR2L0bPxY_M"" target=""_blank"">courtesy of YouTuber Colmarr.</a></p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/hR2L0bPxY_M?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Angel Eyes</em>, despite its seeming irrelevance, had some surprisingly prescient ideas. Not only is it one of the first-ever “all women” fighting games, but it is also one of the first 2D fighters to feature a heavy slant on juggles and air combos. Perhaps its funniest and most bizarre mechanic, however, is reserved for the so-called “reverse combo correction” system, which actually<em> increases</em> damage the longer a combo goes on — rather than scales it back. And thus, players with one or two fairly solid combos can find themselves taking down their opponents in a manner of seconds.</p>
<p>You thought <em>Street Fighter V</em> was “three mistakes to death”? Try “one mistake to death”!</p>
<p>Despite its simplistic nature and dopey mechanics, Angel Eyes is, understandably, not without its charm. Though it would receive a JPN PlayStation point in 1997, the series would quietly disappear into the annals of fighting game history. Still, it’s lovely to see it again. And, as opposed to a lot of the Arcade Archives releases, <em>Angel Eyes</em> is a title that actually requires archiving, due to its obscure, rare nature.</p>
<p><em>Angel Eyes</em> is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

<h2>Toss a coin to a linear narrative</h2>

<h2>Pastures new for veteran producer</h2>
<p>Veteran Capcom producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi has announced that they have left the <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Street Fighter</em> developer to take a new role at the Chinese conglomerate NetEase. Kobayashi shared the news with friends, fans, and followers <a href=""https://twitter.com/HiroKobaP/status/1557895229021118464?s=20&amp;t=JvBOIN8mOUhnj9NNktzWaQ"" target=""_blank"">on Twitter earlier today</a>, which just so happens to be the producer’s 50th birthday.</p>
<p>“I would like to share something very special with everyone,” began Kobayashi. “After serving 27 years with gratitude, I have departed from Capcom on March 31st and will officially be joining NetEase Games as a producer. I will strive to continuously create more enjoyable entertainment experiences for everyone at this new company, in this new era. Thank you for your continued support.”</p>

<p>In the near-three decades spent with Capcom, Kobayashi has worked alongside some of the company’s most successful and recognizable brands. Kobayashi started out as a key coder for the groundbreaking survival horror title Resident Evil, with the following years seeing him rise through Capcom’s ranks as a planner, associate producer, and eventually executive producer on titles such as<em> Dino Crisis, killer7, Devil May Cry,</em> and the <em>Sengoku Basara</em> franchise.</p>
<p>Kobayashi’s move to NetEase Games can be seen as another step in the studio’s desire to become a bigger play both within the games industry and on the global stage. NetEase already works as a China-based partner to Activision Blizzard, and recently announced the opening of its first U.S.-based studio, <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/china-tech-giant-netease-opens-first-u-s-studio-jackalope-games/"" target=""_blank"">Jackalope Games.</a> NetEase Games has been searching for notable staff members over the past year, which included courting <em>Yakuza</em> creator Toshihiro Nagoshi. Nagoshi now operates his own studio as a NetEase subsidiary.</p>

World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King Classic launches globally today and Destructoid sister site Icy Veins is here to tell you all about it, including an assortment of guides.
Global Release Times
Wrath Classic launches in the Americas, Europe, Taiwan, Korea, and Australia/New Zealand simultaneously. Check the details below for the exact time you can log in to the game and explore all that the new expansion has to offer.

What’s New?

New Continent: Northrend – Heroes will begin their journey in one of two zones in Northrend — Borean Tundra or Howling Fjord. A vast new continent awaits!
New Hero Class: Death Knights – Available to both factions at Level 55, Death Knights harness the powers of darkness to help combat the evil that threatens Azeroth. In Wrath Classic, Blizard is bypassing the requirement for a player’s first Death Knight character, unless they decide to pick a fresh realm.
New Profession: Inscription – Scribe mystical glyphs that modify the properties of spells and abilities or create powerful trinkets and off-hand items.
Achievements – Show off your accomplishments and earn various rewards in WoW Classic!
Dungeons &amp; Raids – Multiple new dungeons and 3 raids will be available during Phase 1.

Wrath of the Lich King Classic is included with existing World of Warcraft subscriptions. If you subscribe to World of Warcraft, you can also play Wrath of the Lich King Classic at no additional cost.

New Hero Class: Death Knight
Death Knights are a new Hero Class available in Wrath Classic. They start at Level 55 in Ebon Hold and have 3 specializations to choose from: Blood, Frost, and Unholy. You do not need an existing Level 55 character on the same realm to create your first Death Knight in Wrath Classic. Fresh start realms are an exception to the rule. Any Death Knight created after your first one must be on a different realm, and requires an existing Level 55 character on the same realm. Completing the Death Knight intro in Wrath Classic rewards the Frostbrood Proto-Wyrm mount on live servers.
If you’re playing a Death Knight in Wrath Classic, we have a set of guides specifically tailored to help you with leveling, gearing, talents, addons, and macros.
Death Knight PvE &amp; PvP Guides
Death Knight Gear Guides
Talent Guides
Inscription is a new Profession that lets you craft powerful items called glyphs that enhance spells and abilities. Scribes can create various trinkets and off-hand items.


We’ve all been there! It is always difficult to choose a class, especially in an MMORPG like World of Warcraft, and when you finally decide which class to play, it’s time to start leveling! The cap has been raised to Level 80 in Wrath Classic (up from Level 70 in Burning Crusade Classic).
If you do not plan on maining a Death Knight, we have leveling guides for other classes as well with recommended builds and talents.

<h2>She’s a good girl, loves her mama</h2>
<p>With over two million copies sold, the role-playing game <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-greedfall/"" target=""_blank""><em>GreedFall</em></a> is getting a sequel. Spiders and Nacon are circling back for <em>GreedFall 2</em>, a prequel set three years before the rough but charming original game, and it’s launching for PC and consoles in 2024.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_HS1Kb31UE?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>Today’s announcement trailer sets the mood (and I fear for those hounds), but there’s also a more detailed summary of what to expect from <em>GreedFall 2</em>. It’s a POV swap.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This time you play as <strong>a native of Teer Fradee</strong>, uprooted by force from your island and <strong>taken to the continent of Gacane, where the colonists are from</strong>.”</p>
<p>“In this old world ravaged by war and scarred by the Malichor plague and the political scheming of the different factions, you must regain your freedom and control of your own destiny. Using diplomacy, cunning, or combat, as well as help from allies you make, it’s up to you to end one man’s ambitions of conquest, which could spell the end for the continent and your island.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meaningful player choices in a not-that-common RPG setting from a studio that isn’t afraid to punch above its weight? Yeah, <em>GreedFall 2</em> should be another interesting one.</p>
<h2>Rising expectations</h2>
<p>If the original game ends up feeling like a proof-of-concept compared to this hopefully tighter, more confident sequel, then that’s a win-win. It’s great that there’s still a place for big, rough, memorable RPGs that don’t need to reach triple-A sales figures. Whether you’re into <a href=""https://www.pcinvasion.com/greedfall-review-to-tame-a-land/"" target=""_blank"">these kinds of RPGs</a> or not, I think we can all agree that it’s nice to see something try and stand out from the polished-to-“perfection” big-budget crowd.</p>

<p>Now, hold on a sec — aren’t these developers busy with <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/steelrising-delayed-september-2022-gameplay-video-gameinformer-nacon/"" target=""_blank""><em>Steelrising</em></a>? Well, yes.</p>
<p>“While we were working on <em>Steelrising</em>, our love of the <em>GreedFall</em> universe never faded, and so we are thrilled to be returning to it,” Spiders founder and director Jehanne Rousseau said in a press release. “In this new chapter, players will explore the old continent with its bigger and more diverse environments. They will meet new companions and new factions, and I hope they will have unforgettable adventures.”</p>
<p>It’s an early announcement given the launch timing, but 2024 sounds like a reasonable bet. Nacon hasn’t committed to specific platforms yet beyond <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_2/"" target=""_blank"">PC</a> and “consoles,” so we’ll have to see where <em>GreedFall 2</em> lands. For context, the first game was playable on Steam, PS4, and Xbox One. By the time 2024 rolls around, who knows what the subscription service and PC storefront landscape will look like. I’m sure Nacon will crunch the numbers.</p>

		<h2>The strategy RPG is making its way to Nintendo’s portable console</h2>
<p>Tactics fans keep getting more games, and that now includes a surprising port from Aksys Games. <em>Record of Agarest War </em>is making its way to Nintendo Switch in March 2023.</p>
<p>This strategy RPG originally released in 2007 in Japan, eventually making a western debut on the PlayStation 3 in 2009. It’s since been ported to many other platforms and now, years and years later, it pops up again on Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjCvtrHq0kM"" target=""_blank"">here</a>:</p>

<p>No details have been listed yet about whether this will have any new enhancements or features.</p>
<h2>Generations of war</h2>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with <em>Record of Agarest War</em>, it’s a strategy RPG with a dating twist. Developed as a collaboration between Compile Heart, Red Entertainment, and Idea Factory, you play as several different protagonists embroiled in conflict.</p>
<p>But the way you navigate through the plot is, well, through generations. As the first protagonist, you can romance and marry one of several party members. Then, your child goes on to be protagonist number 2. This plays out across several generations, with the chosen bride affecting the next hero’s stats and aspects of their appearance.</p>
<p>So yes, fans of <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-fire-emblem-awakening/"" target=""_blank""><em>Fire Emblem: Awakening</em></a>‘s child-unit min-maxing might want to take note. This is a bit of a surprise, as <em>Agarest War </em>has been a more niche series in the pantheon of SRPG discussion. But the genre has been surging, with both <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-triangle-strategy/"" target=""_blank"">new titles</a> and <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/tactics-ogre-reborn-coming-this-november-to-playstation-pc-and-switch/"" target=""_blank"">remasters of old classics</a>. It looks like Aksys wasn’t going to let <em>Agarest War </em>sit on the sidelines for this tactical resurgence.</p>
<p>The news arrived as part of an Aksys announcement <a href=""https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1629481216"" target=""_blank"">stream</a>, alongside several other game announcements. <em>Cuddly Forest Friends </em>is set to arrive on Switch in 2023, <em>Spooky Spirit Shooting Gallery</em> heads to Switch in summer 2023, and <em>Tengoku Struggle -Strayside- </em>is set for Switch in 2024.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

Get some coins ready for your Witcher
The second season of The Witcher is locked in for the holidays. Netflix announced today that The Witcher Season 2 will arrive on the streaming service on Dec. 17, 2021.
The news is part of today’s WitcherCon festivities, and a few more details about the upcoming season have been teased. Netflix posted a list of titles for each episode (barring the last one), and some behind-the-scenes interviews point at how characters’ stories might start to intersect in the second season. [Update: Netflix just posted the teaser trailer for the second season as well.]

The Witcher seems to be a hit for Netflix, as there looks to be some indications that the streaming service plans to keep it going. And though it hasn’t quite caught up yet to the stories of the video games, it’s been fun as a book reader to see some of these original stories—especially those about Geralt and Yen—adapted.
If you were hoping for some news about a Witcher game today, however, the bad news is there won’t be any. CD Projekt confirmed there won’t be any reveal of a new Witcher game during today’s presentation.
Still, at least the holidays will be filled with that Witcher cheer. We’ll see what’s next for Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri on Dec. 17.

<h2>Don’t move, you can really get hurt</h2>
<p>One bit of criticism I have for Evo 2022 is just how late it’s allowing these tournaments to go. Day 2 went on for so long that it technically ended on Day 3. With another post-midnight finish in the works for the final day of the show, the folks at Arc System Works gave everyone a break by bringing their big announcement for <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-guilty-gear-strive/"" target=""_blank""><em>Guilty Gear Strive</em></a> to the Evo stage <em>before</em> the Top 8 tournament started. And what an announcement it was. Not only is Bridget coming to the game as part of <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em>‘s second season of DLC, but Bridget will be playable starting tomorrow, August 8.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/eMlf83j7WD8?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>Armed with a yo-yo and mechanized teddy, Bridget debuted in <em>Guilty Gear X2</em> and has been a fan favorite ever since. A poll conducted by Arc System Works in 2013 named Bridget <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20140624231733/https://arcsystemworks.jp/vote_guiltygear/"" target=""_blank"">the most popular character</a> in the franchise. So it was only a matter of time before Bridget was added to <em>Strive</em>.</p>
<p>With the reveal of Bridget, Arc System Works also reminded fans of its roadmap for the second season of DLC. A second fighter is scheduled to release this year as part of the season pass with the third and fourth characters hitting in 2023 alongside two new battle stages. New fighters are always great, but I love when developers make sure to include new arenas as part of DLC season passes.</p>
<p>In addition to the big Bridget news, it was also revealed that <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> has sold one million copies.</p>

<p>Nintendo is really stressing the “seven characters” thing, noting that each party member will have a unique battle role in “Noah’s party of six.” You’ll also be able to meet “additional characters,” hinting that the overall party, active and non-active, will be larger than prior games in the series, and many modern RPGs as a whole.</p>
<p>Noah is described as a close-range sword wielder, while Mio is a Zephyr, who excels in dodging/evasion and “drawing enemy attention.” You can also swap classes to create your own builds, and party members can “combine if certain conditions are met” to transform into a giant Ouroboros form: par for the course for super attacks in JRPGs.</p>
<p>We also got a taste of the Special Edition of the game, which will launch at a later undisclosed date “exclusively on the My Nintendo store.” It’ll include a special box (with art by Masatsugu Saito), the game itself, a steelbook, and an art book (that Nintendo says has “250+ full color pages”).</p>

It was originally slated for September
Plans have changed! Originally slated for September 2022, Nintendo is now targeting a Xenoblade Chronicles 3 July 29 launch.
The news was shared this morning directly from Nintendo, who gave us a new trailer that showcases “more about the game’s story, characters, and strategic battle system, where you can team up with up to seven characters.” We’ll evidently be put into the role of controlling “Noah and Mio,” as they deal with a conflict between the nations of Agnus and Keves: part of Aionios.
Nintendo is really stressing the “seven characters” thing, noting that each party member will have a unique battle role in “Noah’s party of six.” You’ll also be able to meet “additional characters,” hinting that the overall party, active and non-active, will be larger than prior games in the series, and many modern RPGs as a whole.

We also got a taste of the Special Edition of the game, which will launch at a later undisclosed date “exclusively on the My Nintendo store.” It’ll include a special box (with art by Masatsugu Saito), the game itself, a steelbook, and an art book (that Nintendo says has “250+ full color pages”).
As usual, the Xenoblade series is getting a stylish launch!

		Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs
Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.
The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.

In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.
The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.

For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.

<p><em>Hitman 3 </em>launched right at the start of 2021, and after a year of clever disguises and assassinations, IO Interactive is teasing what’s to come in 2022. Today, the company announced that <em>Hitman 3 </em>Year 2 will kick off with some early updates for PC players, and more to come beyond.</p>
<p><em>Hitman 3 </em>Year 2 will start on Jan. 20, 2022 with support confirmed for another 12 months afterwards. In a blog on the <a href=""https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-3-year-2/"" target=""_blank"">IO Interactive site</a>, the studio confirms this includes new maps, storylines, and ways to play all lined up for next year.</p>

<p>For PC players, a Ray Tracing update is coming to PC in 2022. Virtual reality will also arrive for PC players in January 2022. And a new way to play is already being teased: the Elusive Target Arcade will be a new permanent mode, as a twist on the established Elusive Target formula. More details will be announced in early January 2022, and Spring 2022 will hold a “major update” for <em>Hitman 3 </em>as well.</p>
<p>It sounds like a lot of content is set to arrive in <em>Hitman 3 </em>Year 2. This entry, and the rebooted <em>Hitman </em>trilogy, seems to have garnered it too; as part of today’s announcement, IO Interactive confirmed that the World of Assassination trilogy has reached 50 million players, and <em>Hitman 3 </em>is now the most successful <em>Hitman </em>game of all time.</p>
<p><em>Hitman 3 </em>seems to <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-hitman-3/"" target=""_blank"">have left its trilogy on a good note</a>, and now it’s getting even more to do with Year Two. We’ll see what the new year holds for Agent 47 as it all starts rolling out.</p>

<h2>Say Hi to Ol’ Chief Woodenhead</h2>
<p>Indie outfit DreadXP, in association with AMC Networks and Cartel Entertainment, has announced that it has begun the development of a brand new video game based on the iconic horror anthology series <em>Creepshow</em>. Platforms or a release window were not announced.</p>
<p>The new game has been inspired by the TV series currently airing on horror network Shudder, which is itself styled after a trilogy of comically dark movies written and produced by author Stephen King and late director George A. Romero. While horror anthology films have been released in abundance over the past 50 years, the original<em> Creepshow</em> (1982) is still considered perhaps one of the genre’s finest examples — even if the sequels are the very epitome of the law of diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer for this B-movie classic to get a taste of its kooky E.C. Comics vibe.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/owdnnaNs2RI?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>Much like the films and TV series, the <em>Creepshow</em> game will be an anthology, featuring self-contained stories that will apparently span a wide variety of tones and genres. <em>Creepshow</em>‘s trademark shock &amp; gore tactics will be in full effect, as will its delightfully naughty comedic tone. Darkstone Digital’s Brian Clarke will serve as creative director, spearheading several developers’ efforts to bring a unique twisted tale to the compilation. A fun experimental concept, I’m sure you’ll agree.</p>
<p><em>Creepshow</em> represents one of several retro-themed horror titles currently in the works. Gun Interactive is currently hard at work on an asymmetrical multiplayer title based upon Tobe Hooper’s seminal 1974 film <em>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</em> while, more recently, Teravision Games revealed it was making a similar title based upon the dopey 1988 release <em>Killer Klowns from Outer Space</em>. I’m all for this return to the golden genre that gives me lifeblood, of course I am, I just ask that these games be, y’know, good?</p>
<p><em>Creepshow</em> is currently in development at DreadXP.</p>

<h2>In the heart of darkness, there is a method to this madness</h2>
<p>“Correct orders” in any long-running piece of media (<em>Kingdom Hearts</em> included, which has been running for two decades plus!) are always going to be hotly-debated. Everyone has their own take on how people should experience a story, especially when there’s discrepancies between “release order” and “the order that the story makes sense.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, with a little help from compilations, things are a lot less murky. Here’s a surefire way to experience the core <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> story, otherwise known as the Dark Seeker Saga, or the Xehanort Saga.</p>
<h2>Here’s the best order to play the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> games:</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Birth by Sleep</em></li>
<li><em>Kingdom Hearts</em></li>
<li><em>Kingdom Hearts 2</em></li>
<li><em>Kingdom Hearts 3</em></li>
</ul>
<h3><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix</em></h3>
<p>You have two options here: start with <strong><em>Kingdom Hearts 1</em></strong> (makes total sense right?), or go with the first game chronologically, <em>Birth by Sleep</em>. Having played this series inside out, I’d recommend going with <em>Kingdom Hearts 1</em> first.</p>
<p>It kicks off your adventure with Sora (one of the many lead protagonists in the series), who sets the “everyman tone” quite well. You’ll become acquainted with multiple key members of the core narrative, and learn about them from the ground up, as Sora gets acclimated to the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> universe alongside of you.</p>
<p>You have the option here to play <strong><em>Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories</em></strong>, which is a side story that continues the arc of <em>Kingdom Hearts 1</em>, and leads into the second core game. If you’re not up for it, you can certainly skip it, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ffDVncjKlM"">and watch a recap</a>.</p>
<p>I’d recommend playing (or watching, if your version of it is the video-only edition) <strong><em>358/2 Days</em></strong> (a confusingly named game that’s also included in <em>1.5 Remix</em>) after you experience <em>Kingdom Hearts 2</em>. It technically takes place after <em>Kingdom Hearts 1</em>, but you’ll have more background on the characters therein if you wait.</p>
<h3><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix</em></h3>
<p>Don’t worry about the confusing 2.5 moniker! The meat of this compilation is <strong><em>Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix</em></strong>, which is actually just <em>Kingdom Hearts 2</em> with some extra content and tweaks baked in.</p>
<p>From there, you have the option to hop to<strong> <em>Kingdom Hearts Re: coded</em></strong>, or skip it entirely like <em>Chain of Memories</em>. It’s not an essential part of the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> lore, as a side game on the DS.</p>
<p>Although it is not part of <em>HD 2.5 Remix</em>, you can play <strong><em>Dream Drop Distance HD</em></strong> after <em>Re: coded</em>, as it’s next in line. You can find this in the <em>2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em> compilation.</p>
<p>With <em>2.5 Remix</em> also be able to experience <strong><em>Birth by Sleep</em></strong>, which is one of the most important games from a foundational/bedrock perspective. It’s a prequel to most of the core events, and will provide a background on why everything is happening.</p>
<h3><em>Kingdom Hearts 3</em></h3>
<p>Beyond a shadow of a doubt, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-kingdom-hearts-iii/""><em>Kingdom Hearts 3</em></a> is going to be the last game you’ll want to play in the series as it stands right now, full stop.</p>

I can’t help but wonder if Gotham Knights is next
Avalanche Software is pushing its open-world action-RPG Hogwarts Legacy from 2021 to 2022.
The delay was announced on Twitter this morning, with a short statement thanking Harry Potter fans for their “tremendous reaction” to Hogwarts Legacy. “Creating the best possible experience for all of the Wizarding World and gaming fans is paramount to us so we are giving the game the time it needs.”

We’ve only gotten one good look at Hogwarts Legacy – there was a reveal trailer back in September during the PS5 showcase event – but otherwise, we’ve been left to glean details from an FAQ.

<h2>Into the pretty well-known</h2>
<p>Back in 2016, I spent more time than I would like to admit on my phone playing <em>Disney Magic Kingdoms</em>. Developed by Gameloft, <em>Magic Kingdoms</em> is a free-to-play city builder along the lines of <em>Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow</em> and <em>Ice Age Village</em>. I should have been able to resist the urge to download the game as <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/which-is-worse-final-fantasy-xv-a-new-empire-or-futurama-worlds-of-tomorrow/"" target=""_blank"">I am not a fan</a> of this particular offshoot of the city simulation genre. And yet, that Disney “charm” roped me in and had me fussing endlessly about proper placement for all my attractions.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, I’ve found myself fussing endlessly again with <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>, another Gameloft product that hit Early Access this week. Like <em>Magic Kingdoms</em>, the goal of the game is to shape and expand your town while building relationships with familiar Disney characters. A lot of people out there are comparing the game to <em>Animal Crossing</em> or <em>Stardew Valley</em> because they share a lot of similar gameplay elements and name-dropping those titles likely helps with the SEO. But to me, it’s more akin to <em>Disney Magic Kingdoms</em>, just more fleshed-out and fully realized.</p>

<p>It’s almost embarrassing how quickly I lost track of time playing <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>. Literal hours melted into the background as my beautiful Black princess planted carrots, baked pies, mined for gems, and ran errands for a small slathering of iconic Disney characters. Like with any well-developed free-to-play game, which <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em> will be once it leaves Early Access, it’s able to sink its hooks in quickly with enough content to keep players properly engaged.</p>
<p>The central narrative for <em>Dreamlight Valley</em> revolves around your character returning to a special place from their childhood and being whisked away to a fantasy world left asunder by an event known as “the Forgetting.” Its former inhabitants have nearly all fled, and those who remain are left struggling with memories of a time before the night thorns started popping up all over town. As the savior with a magic touch, it’s up to you to clear the night thorns and restore the town to its former glory, while wrangling together the Disney characters who used to call it home. You’ll do this by farming, fishing, crafting, cooking, mining, digging, and helping your new Disney BFFs with their requests.</p>
<p>On paper, I can see how that sounds like <em>Animal Crossing</em>, <em>Stardew Valley</em>, or <em>Story of Seasons</em>. And while its gameplay may hew close to those titles, its objective-oriented progression system is far more restrictive than those more open-ended experiences. You’re not just here to make friends and relax in a laid-back lifestyle, you’re here to complete the various story and friendship quest lines that help build toward the overall goal of restoring the town. Completing these quests, as well as performing just about every action you can in the game, will earn you “Dreamlight”. With this, you’ll be able to open up new areas of the valley and access the different Disney realms where new town inhabitants can be found.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/9PpoGfIeAO0?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<h2>Let’s Get Together</h2>
<p>Just a few of the realms are available right now, covering <em>Ratatouille</em>, <em>Moana</em>, <em>Frozen</em>, and <em>Wall-E</em>. Don’t expect anything too extensive with these realms. They’re not like the worlds you explore in the <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-disney-magical-world-2/"" target=""_blank""><em>Disney Magical World</em></a> games on the Nintendo 3DS. The realms here so far are just small themed areas where you’ll find a character or two asking you for help with a problem. For <em>Ratatouille</em>, Remy needs your help in the kitchen. For <em>Wall-E</em>, it’s all about trash and plants. Complete their requests, which you should be able to do in a matter of minutes, and they’ll agree to come live in your town.</p>
<p>Other characters join the fun as you unlock more of the valley. Initially, it’s just Merlin, Mickey Mouse, and Scrooge McDuck, the latter of whom has the most comically inconsistent voice acting I’ve heard in quite some time. It doesn’t take long for Goofy to appear, and within a few hours, most players should be helping out Ursula too. Add in Mother Gothel, who somehow made the cut for early inclusion, and it’s clear to see that, at least for these opening hours and Early Access period, Gameloft is leaning toward Disney’s more recent history in building its collection of characters. More are on the way, and I suspect as a games-as-a-service title, we’ll see them added with high-profile updates over the next few months and years.</p>
<p>Hopefully, those updates will come with more than just new characters because I’d really like to see more of Disney’s past injected into this game. Outside of the familiar faces, <em>Dreamlight Valley</em> is a largely unremarkable fantasy world that doesn’t share a connection to any particular Disney product. Had this game taken place in a more recognizable location, like Main Street U.S.A., it might feel more sufficiently “Disney” than it does right now. As a lifelong fan of this evil corporation, I appreciate what references have made it so far. Never did I think, in the year 2022, I would hear a character whistling part of the song from the Splash Mountain ride, but here we are.</p>
<p>It would just be nice to see Gameloft go a bit deeper into the Disney catalog as it continues to develop and update this game. For instance, the soundtrack went dead silent when the rain started to fall in the valley. With Disney having a few pieces of music associated with rain—the score to <em>The Old Mill</em>, “The Rain, Rain, Rain Came Down, Down, Down,” and “Little April Shower,” to name a few—it illustrated just how much more history the developers could be pulling from.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Disney-Dreamlight-Valley_20220905112004.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""Ratatouille"" /></p>
<h2>Heigh-Ho</h2>
<p>Of course, all the Disney references in the world won’t matter if people tire too quickly of the gameplay loop. I’ve been obsessed with this game for the past few days, but I’ve also reached a point where I can see a progression wall on the horizon. Some characters are making requests for items I don’t have access to yet, and costs for entering realms and building character dwellings are rising. Character questlines are also becoming increasingly complicated, often dependent on how far I’ve progressed with other characters around town. Add in long wait times for crops to sprout and Dreamlight being earned at a slower pace, and it’s clear I’ve reached the point in a free-to-play game where I’m really going to have to start putting in the time or potentially putting in the money.</p>
<p>In terms of money, <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em> has a battle pass-inspired “Star Path” where completing certain tasks will earn you credits you can use to buy limited-time items. The game is currently hosting a Pixar Fest Star Path, which has a variety of Pixar-themed rewards to earn. Like with most battle passes, there is a free and paid track, the latter of which requires “Moonstones”, the game’s paid currency. There doesn’t appear to be any way to purchase Moonstones in Early Access, but if you buy into the game right now with any of the Founder’s Packs, you’ll be given enough to cover the cost of a few of the Star Paths depending on which edition you spring for.</p>
<p>The cost of the paid track for the Pixar Fest Star Path is 2,500 Moonstones. While you will earn more Moonstones if you purchase the paid track it looks as though, at least for this Star Path event, you can only earn 2,175 of them, which likely won’t be enough to cover the cost of the next featured Star Path.</p>
<p>Like with earning Dreamlight, completing tasks for the Star Path will require a lot of repetition. Cook this many meals, pick this many fruits, sell this many items, etc. Obviously, this ties into <em>Dreamlight Valley</em>’s gameplay loop, but I do wonder if such a system could lead to faster player burnout. How many times are players going to be up for picking 100 fruits or collecting 10,000 coins before they get bored of it? It’s one thing to offer these activities as optional or spread out over the life of the game. It’s another thing to tie these types of tasks to temporary events and fleeting rewards.</p>

<h2>Oo-De-Lally</h2>
<p>But such is the nature of a free-to-play game. It may look like something designed with the console crowd in mind, but at its core, it’s no different than what Gameloft did with <em>Disney Magic Kingdoms</em>. The only difference is this is a much more engaging experience. If you do decide to jump into <em>Dreamlight Valley</em> during its Early Access period, know that I did encounter a few issues that did encumber my progression for a few hours, including ridiculously scarce seaweed–a <em>vital</em> crafting ingredient–and little woodland creatures that refused to stop so I could feed them.</p>
<p>In a way, <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em> is a wish come true for me. I’ve always wanted a wholesome game where I could share a fully realized world with the Disney characters I grew up with. And while I’m sure those characters will be added to the game eventually, what’s here is enough to satisfy the 10-year-old inside my soul who’s eating a Mickey Mouse waffle at Goofy’s Kitchen while getting an autograph from some criminally underpaid guy in a Pluto costume.</p>

Into the pretty well-known
Back in 2016, I spent more time than I would like to admit on my phone playing Disney Magic Kingdoms. Developed by Gameloft, Magic Kingdoms is a free-to-play city builder along the lines of Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow and Ice Age Village.

<h2>Better luck next year</h2>
<p><em>Overwatch 2</em> and <em>Diablo IV</em> are looming on the horizon, but 2021 is shaping up to be a quiet year for Blizzard, at least as far as those big-name sequels go.

<p>Expanding on Ahmad’s <em>Diablo II</em> suggestion, Vicarious Visions – which we recently learned was rolled into Blizzard – is rumored to be <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/vicarious-visions-might-be-working-on-blizzard-s-diablo-ii-remake-617774.phtml"" target=""_blank"">working on a remake</a>.

<p>It’s been a morale-eroding couple of years for Blizzard fans in terms of corporate controversies, departures, and shaky releases, no doubt about it. I can’t say I have the utmost faith in the future of the company, but it’s still home to talented creators, and I hope things start turning around soon.</p>

Activision says Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 will not launch this year. 
Sounds like Overwatch 2 will come in 2022.
— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) February 4, 2021
Expanding on Ahmad’s Diablo II suggestion, Vicarious Visions – which we recently learned was rolled into Blizzard – is rumored to be working on a remake. If it’s happening, that’ll buy Diablo IV some breathing room. On the flip side, Blizzard can’t afford another Warcraft III: Reforged situation.
It’s been a morale-eroding couple of years for Blizzard fans in terms of corporate controversies, departures, and shaky releases, no doubt about it. I can’t say I have the utmost faith in the future of the company, but it’s still home to talented creators, and I hope things start turning around soon.
Our next update should arrive in two weeks – the remote BlizzConline event starts February 19.

<h2>A flood of cozy simulators in the wake of <em>Stardew</em>‘s success</h2>
<p>It feels like with every new batch of gaming news streams we get, they’re accompanied by memes about whichever game genre dominates the announcements and updates. Over the summer, there was an endless stream of dark space marine shooters, and after the news streams that rolled through this week, it seems there’s a new genre <a href=""https://www.polygon.com/23351439/nintendo-direct-farm-rpg-simulator-harvestella-story-of-seasons"" target=""_blank"">taking over the industry</a> for the next few months: farming simulators.</p>
<p><i>Ooblets</i>, <i>I Am Future</i>, <i>Dreamlight Valley, Potion Permit, Bear and Breakfast, Witchbrook, My Time at Portia, Wytchwood, Homestead Arcana, Little Witch in the Woods, Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life — </i>the list of upcoming or newly released farming/community sims never-ending these days. This is excellent news for me, considering it’s one of my favorite genres ever, and you can bet your bottom dollar I’m playing as many of them as I can.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ooblet-run.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" alt /></p>
<h3>Why was <em>Stardew</em> so popular?</h3>
<p>While farming/community sims have been around for a long, long time, I think we can accredit a lot of their recent resurgence to the success of one stellar indie game: <i>Stardew Valley</i>. It’s one of those games that’s simple enough to pick up and start playing regardless of your skill level and even regardless of where you are in any given save file, yet still complex enough for players to challenge themselves and min-max the crap out of it if they want to.</p>
<p>The controls are simple and you can run it on anything, which means it’s available (as well as affordably priced) on every conceivable platform. The game has fostered a <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stardew-valley-mods-list-make-the-game-feel-fresh-again/"" target=""_blank"">rich modding community</a>, who enjoy putting a fresh spin on the gameplay, story, characters, aesthetics, and so on.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s the passion project of a single developer, and has all of the charm and care you might expect from someone who truly loves what they’re making. All of these elements came together to not just create an unforgettable game, but a full-on cultural phenomenon that swept through the industry and made <i>Stardew</i> one of the most beloved and successful indie games of all time.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Stardew-Valley-mods-screenshot.jpg?resize=640%2C406&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""Stardew Valley update 1.6 will help modders"" /></p>
<h3>Cause and effect</h3>
<p>If my hypothesis is correct, that means that now over six years after its release, we are seeing <i>Stardew Valley</i>’s influence ripple through the industry — hence the wave of cozy farming/community simulators. Of course, we have to give credit where it’s due to series like <i>Animal Crossing</i> and <i>Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons </i>for paving the way for this once niche genre to break further into the mainstream, but I truly believe <i>Stardew</i> is what pushed it over the edge due to its universal appeal and subsequent popularity.</p>
<p>So now we have a wave of all kinds of games that are putting their own spin on the classic farming/community sim formula, which is a ton of fun to see. Just like shooters or RPGs take the mechanical motifs of their genre and try to do something no one has quite seen before down to the most minute level, simulators are seeing the same level of impassioned scrutiny.</p>
<p>Video games are still an incredibly young medium compared to film, television, literature, or even their older cousin, tabletop games. As someone who has studied patterns and whole movements that form in media, I can’t express how cool it is to see developers explore the intricacies of a newer genre and create something new.</p>

<h3>Carving a new path</h3>
<p>So for example, most of these games are going to have mechanics like farming, mining, fishing, cooking, crafting, befriending townspeople, etc., but the combination in how these mechanics are implemented and influence each other will always be unique. Each game will have different economic and social systems for the player to interact with that will lead to different outcomes.</p>
<p>It’s like how a lot of games like <i>BioShock</i>, <i>Mass Effect</i>, and <i>Dishonored</i>, for example, have some kind of magic mechanic to supplement weapons that we know and recognize, like guns, daggers, etc. While we’re familiar with the motif of magic supplementing familiar weapons, each game that implements its own kind of magic will use that magic slightly differently — what the magic can do will be different, the cost of that magic will be different (usually utilizing some kind of mana system, which can also have an infinite number of variations), and so on. There are a lot of layers here.</p>

<p>My point is, we have enough farming simulators now that by nature of a saturated (and nearly oversaturated) market, developers are forced to think creatively when it comes to using the mechanics in the toolbox of their genre to create as engaging of an experience as possible.</p>
<p>Then we get games like <i>Cult of the Lamb</i> or <i>Ooblets</i>, which combine community simulation with an action roguelike and farming simulation with <em>Pokémon</em>-style animal companion battling, respectively. Like storytelling, the key to making fresh and exciting games is finding new ways to combine and implement elements we already love.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to study that phenomenon in retrospect, but it’s another to see it happen in real time. Regardless of what some people say, I think this is a very, very exciting time for games — especially farming simulators.</p>

<p>Microsoft has been doing a bang-up job with Project xCloud, its foray into cloud-powered game streaming. In fact, it’s not an unpopular opinion that Xbox is doing it better than Google Stadia — and Project xCloud is still in beta and free. Microsoft wants to position itself as a powerhouse in leveraging its Azure cloud technology for game streaming, and these first steps indicate that’s a very realistic outcome.</p>
<p>However, the beta has been restricted to mobile devices thus far, and Android devices at that. That changes today.

<p>The iOS rollout is starting extremely slow, though — mostly because of restrictions with Apple’s TestFlight preview program. Only 10,000 people will be invited to the preview, and those people will probably be cycled in and out throughout the beta. Also, only one game will be included, <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>, due to an App Store policy.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s needed for the Project xCloud beta on iOS: A Microsoft account associated with an Xbox Gamertag, an iPhone or iPad running iOS 13.0 or higher and Bluetooth 4.0 or higher, a Bluetooth-enabled Xbox One wireless controller, access to Wi-Fi or mobile data that supports 10Mbps-down bandwidth.</p>
<p>If you meet the criteria and want in, take a shot at registering.

<h2>‘Women Don’t Sell’</h2>
<p>A new report into toxic culture at Ubisoft suggests that 2018 open-world adventure<em> Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em> was initially designed with only one protagonist in mind: Spartan mercenary Kassandra. However, execs at the publisher demanded the sequel include an alternate male protagonist, <a href=""https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1285527461300711424?s=20"" target=""_blank"">reportedly telling the team that “Women don’t sell.”</a></p>
<p>This latest revelation is part of an investigative report <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-21/ubisoft-sexual-misconduct-scandal-harassment-sexism-and-abuse"" target=""_blank"">conducted by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier,</a> which reveals that the<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> team has faced a <a href=""https://twitter.com/disco_jill/status/1285590827830517761?s=20"" target=""_blank"">persistent uphill battle</a> in regards to spotlighting women characters. The report suggests that <em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em>‘s Evie had her role significantly reduced during development, while an early blueprint for 2017’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Origins</em> originally included a scenario where protagonist Bayek’s wife, Aya, would don the famous bladed gauntlet.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, as far as<em> Odyssey</em> is concerned, our own user poll shows the majority of our readers <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/assassin-s-creed-odyssey-director-surprised-at-alexios-kassandra-usage-split-535187.phtml"">preferred playing Kassandra over her male counterpart, Alexios.</a> And ultimately, it was stated by creative director Jonathan Dumont <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/8suomv/hi_im_jonathan_dumont_creative_director_of/?sort=qa"">in a 2018 Reddit AMA</a> that Kassandra’s tale should be considered the canon story of the Grecian epic.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/kassandra-ubisoft.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<p>The Bloomberg report cites that the pressure to abstain from women leads in the multi-million dollar franchise generally came from both Ubisoft’s marketing department and its former chief creative officer Serge Hascoët, <a href=""https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1282090816694112256?s=20"" target=""_blank"">previously described by Schreier</a> as “the most powerful creative force at the company,” who could greenlight or cancel a project “with one word.”</p>
<p>Hascoët is one of a number of high-ranking officials who recently left <span>–</span> or were fired<span></span> from <span>– </span>Ubisoft amidst a storm of horrifying allegations of sexual abuse and toxicity toward women within the company. Speaking to <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-06-26-ubisoft-addresses-allegations-against-multiple-staff-investigating-further"">Eurogamer</a> last week, Ubisoft has since stated it had “fallen short” in its efforts to provide a safe and inclusive environment for its staff, and that it had launched an investigation into the recent allegations using “specialised external consultants.”</p>
<p>Additionally, as reported by <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-07-22-french-union-preparing-collective-lawsuit-against-ubisoft-amid-abuse-allegations"">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, French union <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://solidairesinformatique.org/2020/07/22/appel-a-temoignages-en-vue-dune-action-collective-en-justice-contre-le-groupe-ubisoft-english-version-below/"">Solidaires Informatique</a> has announced the establishment of a collective lawsuit against Ubisoft, putting out an open call to the publisher’s staff for accusers and witnesses.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/eivor-female-ubisoft-noscale.jpg?resize=640%2C346&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<p>Ubisoft is currently gearing up for the release of the newest entry in the<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> series, <em>Valhalla</em>, which once again features dual protagonists <span>–</span> though players will be able to select between a male and female lead at will throughout the game. Still, <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/assassin-s-creed-valhalla-trailer-introduces-the-fearsome-eivor-597721.phtml"" target=""_blank"">the most recent trailer</a> for the sequel focused specifically on the male variant of Eivor, who is currently far more prominent in<em> Valhalla</em>‘s marketing materials.</p>
<p>There is still work to be done before the outdated attitude toward women in leading roles dissipates in some of Ubisoft’s biggest blockbuster brands. Perhaps the company would do well to take the lead from its own <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/action-packed-rainbow-six-siege-cinematic-represents-an-evolution-for-the-franchise-581133.phtml"" target=""_blank""><em>Rainbow Six Siege</em></a>, a title that features a wide selection of women characters, of various nationalities and backgrounds, that are showcased proudly throughout the franchise’s lore, artwork, trailers, and merchandising campaigns. Maybe you get a pass from marketing if you’re carrying guns and grenades.</p>
<p><em>Far</em> more importantly Ubisoft <span>–</span> as with all companies <span>–</span> must root out and eradicate the misogyny, abuse, and toxic behaviour embedded within its infrastructure, from its front door to the core of its executive levels. Hopefully, this will result in the creation of a safer, healthier, and more inclusive environment for all of its employees.</p>
<p>And as far “Women don’t sell” goes… I guess nobody told<em> Tomb Raider</em>, or <em>The Last of Us</em>, or <em>Uncharted: The Lost Legacy</em>, or <em>Resident Evil 3</em>, or <em>Bayonetta</em>, or <em>Control</em>, or <em>Horizon: Zero Dawn</em>, or…</p>

Speaking to Eurogamer last week, Ubisoft has since stated it had “fallen short” in its efforts to provide a safe and inclusive environment for its staff, and that it had launched an investigation into the recent allegations using “specialised external consultants.”
Additionally, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz, French union Solidaires Informatique has announced the establishment of a collective lawsuit against Ubisoft, putting out an open call to the publisher’s staff for accusers and witnesses.

Ubisoft is currently gearing up for the release of the newest entry in the Assassin’s Creed series, Valhalla, which once again features dual protagonists – though players will be able to select between a male and female lead at will throughout the game. Still, the most recent trailer for the sequel focused specifically on the male variant of Eivor, who is currently far more prominent in Valhalla‘s marketing materials.
There is still work to be done before the outdated attitude toward women in leading roles dissipates in some of Ubisoft’s biggest blockbuster brands. Perhaps the company would do well to take the lead from its own Rainbow Six Siege, a title that features a wide selection of women characters, of various nationalities and backgrounds, that are showcased proudly throughout the franchise’s lore, artwork, trailers, and merchandising campaigns. Maybe you get a pass from marketing if you’re carrying guns and grenades.
Far more importantly Ubisoft – as with all companies – must root out and eradicate the misogyny, abuse, and toxic behaviour embedded within its infrastructure, from its front door to the core of its executive levels. Hopefully, this will result in the creation of a safer, healthier, and more inclusive environment for all of its employees.
And as far “Women don’t sell” goes… I guess nobody told Tomb Raider, or The Last of Us, or Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, or Resident Evil 3, or Bayonetta, or Control, or Horizon: Zero Dawn, or…

<p>Immediately after the <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em> special edition went on sale, the entire Nintendo storefront crashed.

<p>Launching any sort of “special edition” in 2022 with worldwide production issues on the rise is going to be a circus. Add Nintendo to that equation, who still hasn’t quite figured out how to distribute them in general (including midnight rollouts for pre-orders that sell out in a few minutes), and you have a whirlwind of problems.

<p>In what might be the leakiest BlizzCon yet, we knew a new form of <em>Overwatch</em> was coming. Was it <em>Overwatch 2</em>? Is it an <em>Overwatch </em>1.5? No, it’s <em>Overwatch 2</em>, as per the marketing materials. Blizzard shared the news today by way of a cinematic trailer in true BlizzCon fashion. Echo made an appearance, as did most of the classic good-guy gang.</p>
<p>Story missions (PVE) are a thing, as are hero missions (“highly replayable co-op experiences”), and it seems like we’re getting an actual…story this time. There’s new PVP maps as well (Toronto is the first Canadian map!), on top of a new look and new heroes like <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://v1cdn.destructoid.com/BlizzConRecap1.jpg"">Sojourn</a>. The classic heroes are getting a new look as well and the engine is being upgraded.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick rundown of the PVE component: “Players will take an active role in the <em>Overwatch</em> saga as a new global crisis unfolds through a series of intense, high-stakes four-player missions. As the story progresses, players will team up as different sets of heroes and fight to defend the world from the omnic forces of Null Sector, uncover the motives behind the robotic armies’ attacks, and come face-to-face with rising new threats around the globe.”</p>
<p>Director Jeff Kaplan notes that there will be a brand new “core” game mode called Push that will be featured in the Overwatch League. Kaplan promises “tons of PVE content” and the first map, Rio, is playable today at BlizzCon. He also says that “sequels make [Blizzard] nervous,” and the company is “redefining what a sequel means.” All original players of the current game will get to play on the same maps as <em>Overwatch 2 </em>players and progression will carry over.</p>
<p>“Does this mean Overwatch is back?” “Yes, yes we are.”</p>

Got news?  tips@destructoid.com

We literally get 400(!) emails every day, so make it fun/obnoxious. Of course, you can also blog about it yourself, but please don’t spam. Here’s some guidelines on what’s cool to post. Gamers are the canniest internet crowd, so be on point.
FAQ &amp; Support
How do I log into Disqus? For our long-time readers with old-school Disqus accounts, logging into the Destructoid front page can be tricky. We’ve got a full guide over here.
Where’s the dark theme? Turn it on in your preferences.
Can’t remember your password? There’s no separate password reset page – just try to login using any password and your email address (try a few) and we will automagically send you a reset link. Check your spam folders.
Getting warped around to and old/dupe account? You probably have 2 more accounts. Logout/Login with a bad password on every old email address you can think of, and then check your spam folders for our reset links. Come back to this page to rename your dupe username/email.
Still need help? You are the 1%! We’re support@destructoid.com
Our community blogs are not for plugging your cool project
Developer blogs are encouraged but drive-by Kickstarter promoters will be removed without warning. This is a gaming community, not a free classifieds board. Here’s some common sense advice if you’re halfway thinking about being spammy.

Physical mailing address
Yeah, no. Destructoid is now based out of Tokyo, so please don’t mail us anything unless you want to spend a silly amount of money. You should probably email us first and arrange for one of our writers in America to look at your thing. Hit us up: reviews@destructoid.com.

EDITORIAL INACCURACIES AND SUPPORT
Is something factually inaccurate on the home page? Get in touch asap to our proof team and we’ll patch it as soon as humanly possible.
Is something that already exists broken or not working exactly as you’d expect? Please email our engineering horses: support team
Do you have an idea on how to make the web site better? Its best to post your idea so the rest of the community can weigh in on the idea. We prioritize fixes based on what will make our readers most happy, so we do encourage you to get people behind your idea (but please don’t astroturf drama)
PIRACY and COPYRIGHTED CONTENT
We try to keep all copyrighted content off our servers, but we also host 200,000+ blogs and unfortunately some stuff slips through the cracks. Our apologies in advance.
For DMCA takedowns please email SUPPORT. We typically take down anything stakeholders ask without question within 48 hours. To expedite this process, please clearly provide proof of ownership in an informal letter.
Pro tip: Don’t send your lawyers after us. A quick note will do. If you want to be a huge dick about it we’re going to have a lot of fun at your expense.

Contests and Community
FAQ: Who owns your community blog?
You do, of course! You own all of your community blogs and posts, and Destructoid licenses them under: creative commons with attribution. We make nightly on-site and off-site backups, but in the case of a nuclear meltdown please make your own local backups so you can sleep better.
Want to give something away, or did you win something in a contest and never get notified? Please get in touch with our community team

Content takedowns
Just shoot us an informal email and we’ll take it down as soon as humanly possible. We take intellectual property concerns very seriously – but please understand that there is a metric f–kton of community uploading going on and we can’t catch everything. If you send us a letter from your lawyer a fluffy kitten will get diarrhea somewhere and it will be on you, man.
If you spammed our site and Google is now penalizing your SEO and want us to take that link down … NOPE! Enjoy your Google penalty forever. No seriously, we will never remove it and we don’t want your takedown money. That’s karma, buddy! Try not sucking in your next life.
If your real name appears on the site / you’re cleaning up your social footprint why not completely change the identity on all your posts instead?
For all other stuff, just shoot an email from the address on the account over to community team. You must be able to reply from that account to remove content.

[Updated Feb 20, 2017 – Added Fig Investing and topic sections were re-organized – Chris]<br />
[Updated Oct 1, 2014 – We moved the ethics statement from our Terms of Service here – Dale/Jordan]</p>
<p>Destructoid is but one voice among an echoing canyon of reverberating noise right now. We can’t magically resolve all of the issues that plague the video game industry as a whole. However, we feel it’s important to disclose some thoughts and policies that the staff holds dear. At the end of the day, we really just want to do our best to serve you the best we can, and we believe the way to do that is by being good and honest people.</p>
<p>We’re proud to have been named one of OpenCritics’s most trusted sites in 2016, and hope to continue earning such accolades by being one of the most open and transparent gaming sites on the web.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL GUIDELINES</strong></p>
<p>As outlined by the Federal Trade Commission, Destructoid makes every effort to follow <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-staff-revises-online-advertising-disclosure-guidelines/130312dotcomdisclosures.pdf"" target=""_blank"">the guidelines </a>set by the FTC, as recommended in 2013. Generally speaking, we make repeated clear and conspicuous disclosures and disclaimers in every author’s biography, and under every editorial where our readers may have any such concern. We view ourselves as a consumer-first publication and do everything in our power to live up to this standard.</p>
<p><strong>EX-DESTRUCTOID STAFF AND ASSOCIATES</strong></p>
<p>The video games industry is very small, and our job involves getting to know the individuals behind the games we play. Many prominent figures in the business have worked at Destructoid in the past. Those relationships don’t simply vanish when they move onto other things. They are, however, set aside and never taken into consideration when we evaluate games.</p>
<p>We also ask for disclosures upfront as part of our employment paperwork, which are updated on a regular basis. When a person leaves Destructoid, their new work history is noted on their bio whenever possible.</p>
<p>You will find disclosures on every employee bio, and a snippet of that appears on every article. When developers, marketers, or sponsors blog here it is clearly labeled as such.</p>
<p><strong>REVIEW SCORES AND FREE PRODUCTS </strong></p>
<p>In every case, we disclose if the product was provided by the manufacturer or if it was purchased on our own. We’ve also made an effort to retroactively pursue disclosures where former staff had any involvement, direct or indirect. Such is the case with <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/review-oddworld-new-n-tasty-278263.phtml"" target=""_blank"">this review of <em>Oddworld</em></a> after learning that a staff member, who was hired after we reviewed the game, was involved with the production as a voice. It seems unnecessary, but when possible, we prefer to be as transparent as possible. We wouldn’t be here without our readers, so we owe it to you. If mistakes are made, we’ll do our best to make it right.</p>
<p><b>CROWDFUNDING / INVESTING </b></p>
<p>As a whole we take disclosures very seriously, and we have continued to make an effort to disclose relationships in all of our reviews. That includes private investments, Kickstarters, Patreons, IndieGoGo, Fig campaigns, and any such other financial contribution that individual staff members are directly involved in or through their family members. These disclosures will also show up in the review itself. If a writer invests in a game, they are barred from writing about it. Similar to disclaimers for ex-staffers, we’ll also provide a note in pertinent news stories that we have an individual who is investing in the game.</p>
<p>As always, no relationships will be factored into coverage, and writers are required by Destructoid to disclose this before they invest. To go a step further, all shift leads (EICs) are forbidden from investing outright, and reviews for these games will be non-scored.</p>
<p><strong>TRAVEL AND GIFTS</strong></p>
<p>Any travel, gift, or product provided by an advertiser is clearly marked as such.</p>
<p><strong>ADVERTISING </strong></p>
<p>Ads on Destructoid are sold by the Enthusiast Gaming Network (Toronto)</p>
<p>Enthusiast works with multiple third-party ad networks to display advertisements on our site. These external teams do not have access or control of the editorial content in any way, shape, or form.</p>
<p>Likewise, the editorial team has no knowledge ahead of time what advertisements may appear on Destructoid, and 100% of ads are hidden when an editor is going about their work on our site.</p>
<p><strong>AUTOMATED SOFTWARE DISCLOSURES</strong></p>
<p>Our web software will automatically insert disclosures for stories that match a certain pattern. For example, if a story is tagged ‘deals’ our software will insert a disclosure stating that we as a company may earn an Amazon.com commission for the sale. This isn’t always the case, as we frequently report deals that have nothing to do with affiliate relationships, but we prefer to err on the safe side. In broad terms, most deals on Destructoid are blogged from the “Dealzon” author account, which also carries a similar disclosure in their bio. This is also the case involving Twitter – we use third-party software to push social media updates automatically. We make every effort for any social media update containing a deal or offer to automatically have clear disclosures when shopping links are concerned, regardless if they financially benefit Destructoid or not.</p>
<p><strong>CORRECTIONS</strong></p>
<p>When a story contains a serious error, such as an error in pricing or factually incorrect statements, we will add a note with [ brackets ] within the editorial, usually at the top. If small spelling or grammatical errors are made that don’t affect the meaning of the story this may be silently corrected by our editors.</p>
<p><strong>SATIRE AND DEFAMATION </strong></p>
<p>In the case of satire, we make every effort to clearly label it as such and use fictional names whenever possible. Our company condemns hate, discrimination, or harassment of anyone ever. While we support thoughtful discourse, there is a very bold line between criticism and harassment. We do not plan to wade into those waters and hope you will not either. <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/what-destructoid-is-what-stfuajpg-means-and-our-terms-of-service-364625.phtml"" target=""_blank"">Please refer to our full terms of use </a>for more information on how we moderate both staff and user conversations.</p>
<p><strong>SEVERITY AND TERMINATION</strong></p>
<p>If it is discovered that an editor at Destructoid willfully withheld ethical conflicts of interest that may or may not have affected their output, the person will immediately be put on suspension and following an investigation may be immediately terminated. We take these matters very seriously.</p>
<p><strong>CONTACT US WITH YOUR CONCERNS</strong></p>
<p>If there is ever an issue <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/contact-us.phtml"" target=""_blank"">please contact us</a>, whatever is on your mind. We’re fairly easy to reach and try to answer all concerns within a day during business hours (Mon-Fri).</p>

<h2>Do you have a PC?</h2>
<p>Blizzard has revealed that <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/diablo-immortal-is-surprisingly-fun-i-just-hope-microtransactions-dont-ruin-it/""><em>Diablo Immortal</em></a> PC <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo-immortal/23787371/diablo-immortal-a-new-plane-of-hell-opens-for-mobile-and-pc-on-june-2"">is going to be a thing</a>, with cross-play and cross-progression between mobile devices to boot.</p>
<p><strong>After all that</strong>, and making a big deal about <em>Diablo Immortal </em>being a mobile-first game, several years after the on-stage fiasco, Blizzard is confirming that the game is coming to PC. The mobile edition is actually arriving on June 2, but in the near future (<strong>also on June 2</strong>), the PC version will be going into “open beta.” Blizzard says that <em>Diablo Immortal </em>PC open beta progress will be “maintained” into the full version. So either way, with cross-progression, you’re covered no matter when you start. The publisher re-iterates that there are “30 million pre-registered players” worldwide that comprise the player base.</p>
<p>While the jury is out on <em>Diablo Immortal</em>‘s quality as a whole, and how it properly utilizes microtransactions: this is good news for the game as a whole. The “mobile-only” portion of the announcement clearly went over poorly with fans, and if Blizzard can steward the PC version properly, and mold it into something even remotely resembling <em>Path of Exile</em>, they could have a little cottage industry for years to come. In fact, if done right, this could be the longest-supported <em>Diablo</em> game to date in terms of totally new content.</p>
<p>With Microsoft coming into the picture at some point, it only spells good things for long-term support. But again, the game’s quality will need to shine on its own: and we have just a little over a month to see it for ourselves.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie.

<h2>A game I’ll be flocking to for years to come</h2>
<p>Before I even started playing <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-cult-of-the-lamb-pc-version-town-builder-action-roguelite/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cult of the Lamb</i></a>, I knew I was going to love it. First off, we’ve got the cute art style going on, so that box was ticked immediately. Plus the conceit of a simulator about running your own cult is hilarious and fresh in its own way.</p>
<p>I think us roguelike and simulator fans can agree that both genres are having something of a renaissance right now, and <i>Cult of the Lamb</i> manages to hit every note in perfect harmony. Now maybe it’s the antidepressants talking, but playing through it has been some of the most fun I’ve had with a game all year.</p>
<p>Part of the worry with having a game with so many different elements is that the player could start to feel overwhelmed — the base-building sim, the punchy roguelike gameplay, the fishing, <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/knucklebones-real-physical-dice-game-cult-of-the-lamb-fan-made/"" target=""_blank"">Knucklebones</a>, and all of the side quests could start to feel like a lot after a while, but they never did.</p>
<p>Instead, each element fed back into the core gameplay really nicely, like bringing characters items to unlock the different cloaks that gave you power-ups in combat, or powering up your followers to get greater rewards when you sacrifice them. What’s more, I found that having so many different types of activities always kept things fresh while still keeping me moving towards to ultimate goal.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/CultoftheLamb_NextFest_061422.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" alt /></p>
<h3><em>Hades</em>‘ lasting impact</h3>
<p><i>Hades </i>has been an undeniable influence on games over the past few years, especially when it comes to the roguelike genre. The hub world in the Underworld felt so alive, because between each run you could come back and decorate, see what’s up with your favorite characters, and see things gradually change over time through the story. Your cult in <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> feels even more alive, in my opinion.</p>
<p>While <i>Cult of the Lamb</i>‘s combat isn’t quite as complex as <i>Hades</i>‘, it instead throws its weight behind the simulation side of things. Using the “crusades” as a means of gathering materials to then return to the main action of the cult — where you’d often have to put out metaphorical fires that ignited while you were gone — is a genius design choice.</p>
<p>With the different weapon and curse types, there was enough variety to keep things fresh. As much as I love <i>Hades</i>, I also tend to be a creature of habit, which means I stick with the one or two weapons I really like in the post-game and just run with those.</p>
<p>I prefer faster weapons like daggers and swords, but I appreciated that the game made me try the axes and hammers, because that’s not something I would have gone out of my way to play with if I had the choice. It made me slow down and change my combat style, and it’s cool that a simple change like limited weapon choice could open up that half of the game in a whole new way.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Cult-of-the-Lamb-Leshy-boss-screenshot.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""Fighting the bishop Leshy in Cult of the Lamb"" /></p>
<h3>Focus on <em>fun</em>damentals</h3>
<p>I think what it comes down to for me is that you can feel how much the idea of fun was at the center of <i>Cult of the Lamb</i>‘s development. There was never a moment in my whole playthrough where I was over what I was doing, and wanted to get back to what was next. I would finish one of my crusades, or catching fish to feed my followers, or earning some extra coins in Knucklebones, and then I would be excited to get to do whatever was next, every time.</p>
<p>That to me is what makes for a perfect gameplay loop — constant immersion because I’m not only enjoying what I’m doing in the moment, but because I also have something to look forward to.</p>
<p>I’m an “out of sight out of mind” kind of person, so it was literally like I was constantly re-falling in love with every aspect of the game when I remembered it existed. That feels silly to admit, but it speaks to the game’s ability to scratch some kind of primal, child-like itch in my brain. That’s good game design for you.</p>
<p><i>Cult of the Lamb</i> isn’t a game that’s going to revolutionize the games industry, but it will stand out as one of the greats in its respective genres, and can hold its own with the best releases of 2022. It’s one of those games that I’ll be reaching for to replay every few years, and I look forward to trying a new build next time around.</p>

A game I’ll be flocking to for years to come
Before I even started playing Cult of the Lamb, I knew I was going to love it. First off, we’ve got the cute art style going on, so that box was ticked immediately. Plus the conceit of a simulator about running your own cult is hilarious and fresh in its own way.

Focus on fundamentals
I think what it comes down to for me is that you can feel how much the idea of fun was at the center of Cult of the Lamb‘s development. There was never a moment in my whole playthrough where I was over what I was doing, and wanted to get back to what was next.

<h2>Simon’s Quest defenders need to take a look</h2>
<p>We’re fortunate to have games like <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-bloodstained-curse-of-the-moon/"" target=""_blank""><em>Bloodstained: Curse of the</em> <em>Moon</em></a> and now <em>Infernax</em>, a new take on classic NES-style <em>Castlevania</em>. I tend to prefer the more <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-castlevania-advance-collection/"" target=""_blank"">exploration-based</a> Igavania approach, but there’s always room in my heart for the simpler — and often much more unforgiving — action-platformers from the 8- and especially 16-bit era.</p>
<p>If that headline and screenshot are speaking to you, check out this trailer.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RDRJG79e5w?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>Coming to us from Berzerk Studio (the team behind <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/531510/Just_Shapes__Beats/"" target=""_blank""><em>Just Shapes &amp; Beats</em></a>) and The Arcade Crew (who’s best known for publishing <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/609110/Blazing_Chrome/"" target=""_blank""><em>Blazing Chrome</em></a> and <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/718590/Dark_Devotion/"" target=""_blank""><em>Dark Devotion</em></a>), <em>Infernax</em> is a side-scrolling action game with health and mana notches at the top of the HUD, pixelated demons to pummel, bosses to outlast, and coins and XP to accumulate. It’s not a throwback game going for total authenticity — you’ll spot numerous modern design touches — but it’s in the divisive <em>Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest</em> wheelhouse, for sure.</p>
<p>The story is about a knight, Alcedor, who’s out to stop an unholy corruption that has taken root in his homeland, which is more than sufficient motivation for a game like this.</p>
<p>In the trailer, the town with strolling villagers looks straight out of <em>Simon’s Quest</em>, and the over-the-top close-up of a dude’s clobbered face reminds me of <em>Bionic Commando</em>. On the “more modern” front, I feel like people are going to have thoughts about the experience point pop-ups, and also this menu. Again, <em>Infernax</em> has XP — and unlockable skills.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Infernax-weapons-skills-armors-menu.jpg?resize=640%2C360"" alt=""Various character skills in Infernax"" /></p>
<p>According to the developer, “a single choice can change the game,” and <em>Infernax</em> has an open-ended world with “many secret areas to uncover” and “multi-endings based on the players’ decisions.” It looks like you can be a squeaky-clean hero or a total antihero, and I’m curious how black-or-white those choices might be. Either way, the retro gameplay looks fun. Gory as hell, but fun! And the old-school <em>Castlevania</em> scene isn’t too crowded.</p>
<p><em>Infernax</em> will release on PC (via <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/374190/Infernax/"" target=""_blank"">Steam</a>), Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in Q1 2022. I can’t say I’m completely sold yet, but I’m very open-minded about it.</p>

Simon’s Quest defenders need to take a look
We’re fortunate to have games like Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon and now Infernax, a new take on classic NES-style Castlevania. I tend to prefer the more exploration-based Igavania approach, but there’s always room in my heart for the simpler — and often much more unforgiving — action-platformers from the 8- and especially 16-bit era.
If that headline and screenshot are speaking to you, check out this trailer.

Coming to us from Berzerk Studio (the team behind Just Shapes &amp; Beats) and The Arcade Crew (who’s best known for publishing Blazing Chrome and Dark Devotion), Infernax is a side-scrolling action game with health and mana notches at the top of the HUD, pixelated demons to pummel, bosses to outlast, and coins and XP to accumulate. It’s not a throwback game going for total authenticity — you’ll spot numerous modern design touches — but it’s in the divisive Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest wheelhouse, for sure.
The story is about a knight, Alcedor, who’s out to stop an unholy corruption that has taken root in his homeland, which is more than sufficient motivation for a game like this.
In the trailer, the town with strolling villagers looks straight out of Simon’s Quest, and the over-the-top close-up of a dude’s clobbered face reminds me of Bionic Commando. On the “more modern” front, I feel like people are going to have thoughts about the experience point pop-ups, and also this menu. Again, Infernax has XP — and unlockable skills.

According to the developer, “a single choice can change the game,” and Infernax has an open-ended world with “many secret areas to uncover” and “multi-endings based on the players’ decisions.” It looks like you can be a squeaky-clean hero or a total antihero, and I’m curious how black-or-white those choices might be. Either way, the retro gameplay looks fun. Gory as hell, but fun! And the old-school Castlevania scene isn’t too crowded.
Infernax will release on PC (via Steam), Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in Q1 2022. I can’t say I’m completely sold yet, but I’m very open-minded about it.

		Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs
Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.
The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.

In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.
The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.

For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.

<p>The first footage of this RE Engine <em>Resident Evil 4</em> remake looks familiar in some spots and foreign in others.

“Survival horror reimagined“
Sony kicked off this afternoon’s State of Play showcase in one of the best ways possible: with a new Resident Evil announcement! We got our first official look at the long-rumored Resident Evil 4 remake, along with a March 24, 2023 release date and confirmation that PlayStation VR2 “content” is currently “in development.” What a way to start!

The first footage of this RE Engine Resident Evil 4 remake looks familiar in some spots and foreign in others. Overall, at least with this specific trailer, it seems like the vibe is more horror-centric. How Capcom will handle some of Resident Evil 4‘s wackier moments remains to be seen and will surely be cause for a lot of speculation, especially after the Resident Evil 3 remake felt trimmed down.

<p>The fantasy-themed <em>Borderlands</em> spin-off game <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-tiny-tinas-wonderlands/"" target=""_blank""><em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</em></a> might have seemed like an experimental one-off, but it’s been successful enough that Gearbox considers it a new franchise, with “future experiences already under development.”</p>
<p>Gearbox Entertainment CEO Randy Pitchford spoke about <em>Wonderlands</em> at Embracer Group’s annual general meeting, as transcribed by <a href=""https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/gearbox-says-tiny-tinas-wonderlands-clearly-a-new-franchise-after-shattering-targets/"" target=""_blank"">Video Games Chronicle</a>.</p>
<p>Summing up <em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</em> as a “major victory,” Pitchford added that the fantasy-tabletop-inspired game “shattered all of our target expectations, both critically and commercially,” and that “in addition to great financial rewards from this victory that will be coming our way in the coming quarters, we have established a firm beachhead.”</p>
<p>“We now clearly have a new franchise on our hands, with future experiences already under development at Gearbox,” Pitchford said.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Gearbox made a move to <a href=""https://www.gearboxsoftware.com/press_release/the-gearbox-entertainment-company-announces-acquisition-of-lost-boys-interactive/"" target=""_blank"">acquire Lost Boys Interactive</a>, the co-development studio on<em> Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</em>, back in April.</p>

<p>That said, even among players who dug this D&amp;D-inspired, overworld-traversing, build-your-own-class shakeup, the season pass really left a bad taste that’s still lingering — the DLC wasn’t substantial enough compared to <em>Borderlands</em> proper, not by a longshot.</p>
<p>I only played through the main <em>Wonderlands</em> campaign once, and never messed with the endgame activities, but that’s normal for me when it comes to the <em>Borderlands</em> series; others, who play these games specifically <em>for</em> the endgame grind, didn’t fare as well.</p>
<p>To sum it up, I think it was worth playing, but any new “experiences” under the <em>Wonderlands</em> umbrella can’t coast on the success of this first game, which had a major curiosity factor going for it. Expectations will be higher next time around.</p>

<h2>Patch 1.5 is coming to all versions of <em>Cyberpunk </em>too</h2>
<p>CD Projekt Red is launching the next-gen version of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of its futuristic open-world game<em> </em>go live today.</p>
<p>In an <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-2077-stream-february-2022/"" target=""_blank"">announcement stream</a> hosted today, CD Projekt Red confirms that both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions are going live today, alongside a five-hour trial of <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>that lasts for 30 days. The next-gen update will also be free for owners of previous-gen versions. PlayStation trophies won’t transfer over between versions, as the two versions are different SKUs. Xbox players can carry achievements over using Smart Delivery.</p>

<p>For the next-gen versions of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the new consoles will get ray-traced local light shadows, performance improvements, faster loading, and more. The PlayStation 5 version will also have some DualSense features.</p>

		<h2>The strategy RPG is making its way to Nintendo’s portable console</h2>
<p>Tactics fans keep getting more games, and that now includes a surprising port from Aksys Games. <em>Record of Agarest War </em>is making its way to Nintendo Switch in March 2023.</p>
<p>This strategy RPG originally released in 2007 in Japan, eventually making a western debut on the PlayStation 3 in 2009. It’s since been ported to many other platforms and now, years and years later, it pops up again on Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>No details have been listed yet about whether this will have any new enhancements or features.</p>
<h2>Generations of war</h2>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with <em>Record of Agarest War</em>, it’s a strategy RPG with a dating twist. Developed as a collaboration between Compile Heart, Red Entertainment, and Idea Factory, you play as several different protagonists embroiled in conflict.</p>
<p>But the way you navigate through the plot is, well, through generations. As the first protagonist, you can romance and marry one of several party members. Then, your child goes on to be protagonist number 2. This plays out across several generations, with the chosen bride affecting the next hero’s stats and aspects of their appearance.</p>
<p>So yes, fans of <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-fire-emblem-awakening/"" target=""_blank""><em>Fire Emblem: Awakening</em></a>‘s child-unit min-maxing might want to take note. This is a bit of a surprise, as <em>Agarest War </em>has been a more niche series in the pantheon of SRPG discussion. But the genre has been surging, with both <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-triangle-strategy/"" target=""_blank"">new titles</a> and <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/tactics-ogre-reborn-coming-this-november-to-playstation-pc-and-switch/"" target=""_blank"">remasters of old classics</a>.

Patch 1.5 is coming to all versions of Cyberpunk too
CD Projekt Red is launching the next-gen version of Cyberpunk 2077. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of its futuristic open-world game go live today.
In an announcement stream hosted today, CD Projekt Red confirms that both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions are going live today, alongside a five-hour trial of Cyberpunk 2077 that lasts for 30 days. The next-gen update will also be free for owners of previous-gen versions. PlayStation trophies won’t transfer over between versions, as the two versions are different SKUs. Xbox players can carry achievements over using Smart Delivery.

For the next-gen versions of Cyberpunk 2077, the new consoles will get ray-traced local light shadows, performance improvements, faster loading, and more. The PlayStation 5 version will also have some DualSense features.
There are also two different modes for visual fidelity: Performance and Ray Tracing. The former uses 4K dynamic scaling with 60 FPS, while the latter introduces shadow and reflection rendering at dynamic 4K and 30 FPS. For Xbox Series S owners, it will have one mode defaulted to dynamic 1440p and 30 FPS.

For all platforms, there’s also an update going live today. Patch 1.5 adds a bunch of new features, including new apartments to purchase, mid-game appearance customization, new weapons, Photo Mode poses, and more.
Crowd AI and combat have also been updated with a bunch of changes, including NPCs that will draw weapons and fight when provoked (that feature is not available on PS4 or Xbox One versions).

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Jhfofq-ehw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

“Nearly 100 amazing indie games” lined up for this year’s Wholesome Direct showcase
There’s not enough time to hear about (much less play) all of the worthwhile video games in the collective cooker, and even if we narrow down our scope to certain genres or moods, our brains can only hang onto so much information at once. But we can try! So while June is going to be another busy month for live-streamed game showcases, I’ve once again got my eye on the Wholesome Direct, a celebration of cute and cozy upcoming indie games.
The Wholesome Direct is back for 2022, and the event is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Pacific on June 11. Here’s a teaser trailer with a preview of some of the curated games.

On the docket so far, we’ve got:

Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus &amp; Butterfly, a visual novel about listening (and being a barista) in a fantasy version of Seattle.
Mail Time, a “cottagecore” delivery adventure game with a glider.
PuffPals: Island Skies, a farming life sim that looks too pure for this world.
SCHiM, an eye-catching platformer about jumping between shadows.
Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley, a storybook adventure with musical puzzles.
Terra Nil, a serene building game about revitalizing ecosystems in wastelands.
And a few more, as teased in this video.

Some of these might’ve been on your radar, but most of them are probably new to you.
The showcase will air on YouTube on Saturday, June 11, and you can expect to see “new game reveals, exclusive footage, and even games that will launch during the show.”

		Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs
Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.
The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.

In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.
The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.

For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.

<h2><em>Unite </em>is celebrating its first year with a heap of new content</h2>
<p>It’s been <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/pokemon-unite-review/"" target=""_blank"">one year</a> since the launch of <em>Pokemon Unite</em>, and the team is celebrating. Over the next few weeks, <em>Pokemon Unite </em>is getting new playable Pokemon, cosmetics, and more to celebrate its first anniversary.</p>
<p>The celebration <a href=""https://unite.pokemon.com/en-us/news/pokemon-unite-anniversary/"" target=""_blank"">starts next week</a>, with the release of Glaceon, the icy Eevee evolution. Glaceon joins on July 21 alongside a challenge, which will let players earn a free Glaceon Unite License.</p>
<p>Two more are expected to join the fray, too. The gigantic Buzzwole enters the arena on August 3. And on August 15, Tyranitar lumbers into battle.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PokemonUnite_AnniversaryRoadmap_071522.jpg?resize=640%2C362&amp;ssl=1"" alt /></p>
<p>Alongside the new playable Pokemon, a new mode is also debuting. Boss Rush will have players team up to take on powerful bosses and earn rewards. Those who finish with higher scores will earn more. The Boss Rush will be available for three periods of time.</p>

<li>August 14 at 5 p.m. PT to August 21 at 4:59 p.m. PT</li>
</ul>
<h2>New duds for the new year</h2>
<p>A new Battle Pass season will also start rolling out on July 21. Season 9 will have new rewards and levels to pursue, all for the goal of having the coolest-looking Pokemon on the <em>Pokemon Unite </em>field.</p>
<p>There will also be a festive log-in bonus for the first anniversary of <em>Pokemon Unite</em>. Logging in for five days between July 21 and October 12 will net you rewards for each day:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 1:</strong> Pikachu and Fashionable Style: Pikachu</li>
<li><strong>Day 2:</strong> Lucario and Concert Style: Lucario</li>
<li><strong>Day 3:</strong> Blastoise and Firefighter Style: Blastoise</li>
<li><strong>Day 4:</strong> Snorlax and Bedtime Style: Snorlax</li>
<li><strong>Day 5:</strong> Sylveon and Checkered Style: Sylveon</li>
</ul>
<p>With those, plus a festive anniversary reward chain to chase too, seems like a lot of freebies are up for grabs in <em>Pokemon Unite</em>. The first anniversary might be a good time to log back in if you’ve lapsed over the last year.</p>

<p>This is one case where I don’t mind seeing a developer go back on something they’ve said.

Normally I’d get my back up about a 5.9GB day-one patch, but when it saves $150 or more on a new fightstick, I think I can handle it. </p>
<p>This is fantastic news for anyone excited about <em>SFV</em> but not so excited about replacing their peripherals. Fighting games are already a hard enough genre to get into without pricing out potential players.</p>

<h2>To buy legacy games, you’ll need to break out your old systems</h2>
<p>Sony is about to make a frustrating change to the PlayStation Store that’s going to hit desktop and mobile users the hardest. Soon, it will no longer be possible to buy PS3, PSP, or Vita games (or their DLC) from the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://store.playstation.com/en-us/home/games"">PlayStation Store</a> if you’re browsing on a web browser or mobile device. That restricted access also goes for apps, themes, and avatars – and the wishlist feature is being “discontinued” too.</p>
<p>What’s the deal? Sony is cleaning house for the fast-approaching PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>The company sent out an email to PlayStation users yesterday with details about these (previously rumored) PlayStation Store changes and when they will take effect. On desktop, the switchover will happen sometime next week. On mobile devices, the removal is happening on October 28, 2020.</p>
<p>Under the new setup, if you want to buy a <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://store.playstation.com/en-us/grid/STORE-MSF77008-ALLGAMES/1?platform=ps3"">PlayStation 3</a>, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://store.playstation.com/en-us/grid/STORE-MSF77008-ALLGAMES/1?platform=psp"">PSP</a>, or <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://store.playstation.com/en-us/grid/STORE-MSF77008-ALLGAMES/1?platform=vita"">PS Vita</a> game, you’ll need to do so <strong>on your original system</strong> using its less-than-ideal storefront. (One of the big reasons why this change is such an annoyance.) If you want to get PS4 apps, themes, or avatars, you’ll need to use your PS4.</p>
<p>To be clear, your purchases aren’t being revoked – “you will still be able to access all your previously purchased PS3, PSP, or PS Vita content as before,” according to Sony. The issue is ease of access.</p>
<p>As for the web-based wishlist feature going away, I don’t get it. That’s just irritating. If you’ve got a bunch of potential games stockpiled for a rainy day, it’s time to take notes and plan accordingly.</p>

<h2>An Endwalker hands-on preview</h2>
<p><sub>[This <em>Endwalker</em> hands-on preview is based on an in-development build of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, and content in the final version is subject to change.]</sub></p>
<p>I’ve been playing <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> for roughly 11 years. Well, I’ve been <strong>enjoying</strong> <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> for X years after the <em>Realm Reborn</em> salvaging job came about. And it’s been pretty crazy to see all of its improvements happen in real-time. Yes, <em>Realm Reborn</em> was pretty great at launch, but it’s gotten so much better since then. That includes <a href=""https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/endwalker/"" target=""_blank"">the upcoming expansion</a>. It’s time for an<em> Endwalker</em> hands-on preview.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Endwalker-hands-on-preview-3.jpg?resize=640%2C336"" alt=""Endwalker hands on preview 3"" /></p>
<p>Square Enix gave us nearly a full day of hands-on time with <em>Endwalker</em>. But before that happened, we got a special presentation from Naoki “Yoshi P” Yoshida himself. It was 45 minutes long. He was rocking a soul patch. Ah, the world of MMO coverage! I wouldn’t trade it for anything.</p>
<p>Yoshida says that although he would have loved to have done an in-person preview this year, it’s basically impossible, noting that Japan is still in a “tough situation,” and he took some time to commend the healthcare industry for allowing his team to continue their work. It’s a bizarre time for both press and developers alike, but it was great to see a heartfelt message from Yoshida, as he’s always been earnest throughout his career, and seems like he actually enjoys his work.</p>
<p>After that brief intro, it was time to get to the content. With music from the expansion blaring in the background, Yoshida gave us his spiel. <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> is now officially at 24 million players, an increase of two million since the last time he checked in, and the game “continues to grow.” Remember when I smack-talked the original version earlier? Yoshida touched on that, noting that it’s amazing how he and his team were able to turn the game around to a “core part of Square Enix’s business” from what it was.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/zTTtd6bnhFs?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s been 11 years since they dropped the 1.0 edition, and on September 30, they’ll hit 12 years and four expansions to <em>Realm Reborn</em>. Yoshida thanks fans for sticking with the game for this long — something he tries to do a couple of times a year, at least — and credits the community for keeping the game alive. Again, I believe his sincerity here.</p>
<p>He recalls how the game grew from four million members after the launch of <em>Heavensward</em> (the first expansion), and how they were “super happy” with that figure because of how they were able to fix the game from its previous state. After <em>Stormblood</em> hit, they grew from 10 million to 16 million <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-xiv-shadowbringers/"" target=""_blank"">before <em>Shadowbringers</em> arrived</a>. The next milestone was surpassed by the “highly acclaimed” <em>Shadowbringers</em>, which now sits at 24 million players. Yoshida vaguely mentioned “10 more years” of plans, and that just because the first saga (Hydaelyn and Zodiark) is over, it doesn’t mean the end.</p>
<p>Onto <em>Endwalker</em>, which is still being referred to as their “largest expansion to date” — which he clarifies is both story and playable content. To recap, there’s six areas, a new hub city, two new jobs (Reaper/Sage), better Trust (CPU party members) AI, new gear/crafting recipes, the Pandemonium raid, a new alliance raid (Myths of the Realm), new dungeons, male Viera race, Island Sanctuary (“relaxed content”), a new tribe (Loporrits), the new data center travel system, the new Oceania region data center, the Ishgard residential district, and a level cap increase to 90.</p>
<p>“More than anything,” he believes people are interested in the new jobs.</p>

<p>Yoshida reiterates from patch 6.1, “a new adventure will begin,” so expect a big finish in the base expansion, as they “tie up loose ends from the last 10 years.” Afterward, the team decided they wanted to “challenge themselves” with a brand new story, and thus the concept for 6.1 was born.</p>
<p>He reminds us that<em> Endwalker</em> will “downscale values” alongside battle changes, and reassures players that they have “nothing to worry about.” This is mostly due to calculation overflow bugs (read: big numbers screwing things up internally), and a reduction of floating text for aesthetic reasons. A number given that was reaching untenable heights was a 440,000,000 HP boss battle. “One-fifth of original values” is the basic number provided, but the game should ostensibly feel the same, and you should “still feel stronger” when leveling. “I assure you you’ll get used to it right away,” he says, and it’s for the best for “the next 10 years of service.”</p>
<p>One immediate bonus is a reduction of leveling up XP requirements. Yoshida says that their philosophy has changed over time, and instead of wanting to see players just focus on one or two jobs, they want to try multiple jobs and playstyles. “It will be super easy to level up every single job,” he says, and you’ll be able to “experience more things” as a result of spending less time leveling.</p>
<p>“Inflation” is another concern, which Yoshida is combating by “abolishing the 999 gil [gold] cap” on teleportation (an example of 1,200 gil fees were mentioned). The aim is to “rebalance the economy,” and I’m sure people will have thoughts when the whole process is finalized. Yoshida reminds players that you can favor destinations to reduce the cost. “Concern for the game’s lore” was also considered when adjusting these values.</p>

<p>A big thing Yoshida harped on in the presentation as well was the ability to do more solo content with AI party members via the Trust system. Yoshida intends to make the game more playable solo with the <em>Endwalker</em> 6.0 Trust enhancements, and is not concerned about “it becoming a non-MMO” as a result. One of his big points is that there are people who are prone to not wanting to group up, and he wants everyone to still experience the story and the game as a whole. He hopes that those people do gravitate toward group activities, but isn’t overly worried about it.</p>
<p>After that, I was whisked away to the<em> Endwalker</em> build (Yoshida says to remind people that this is a “pre-release build that is subject to change”) and swapped to Paladin as quickly as I could (it’s not like people are scrambling for tanks when there’s new healer/DPS jobs!). My demo included two new areas (Thavnair and Garlemald), level 90 jobs (including Reaper and Sage), the Tower of Zot dungeon, and the Old Sharlayan hub were open. No quests were unlocked.</p>
<p>I’ll start with exploration. Thavnair’s aesthetic heavily leans toward “lush jungle” and it’s completely my vibe. Between the ruins and the menacing structures scattered around it, it’s easily one of the coolest-looking zones in the game. Again, no quests or story content was enabled, so we were only able to fly around it — but I was able to clearly see some of the narrative beats that were about to unfold just due to the strong design alone.</p>

<p>Garlemald is a <em>Heavensward</em>-like snowy area. I started in Camp Brokenglass (edgy name amid a zone torn by war), and made my way to the gigantic broken castle motif, which is the centerpiece of the area. It’s bleak, especially when juxtaposed to Thavnair’s thriving nature.  Old Sharlayan is a pristine town that reminds me a lot of Idyllshire. Right now it’s not overly exciting (though I do love cities with plenty of water), but that might change when the main story quests tie me to it emotionally.</p>
<p>The other big place we could try is the Tower of Zot: a new dungeon with plenty of <em>Final Fantasy IV</em> flavor (the Magus Sisters are the core focus and the entirety of the boss gauntlet). You fight two of them sequentially, then all three at once. Combined with the horrifying (and tentacle-filled) art style, it has a ton of flavor. During Zot, I opted to play my go-to Paladin so our group had a tank, with my party members trying out Reaper (x2) and Sage. We cleared it! But afterward, I had to get a feel for both of the new jobs myself and came away impressed on just about every level.</p>
<p>The Reaper was already going to appeal to a certain type of player just based on looks alone, but they back it up mechanically too. The job is heavily combo-based, with some traversal options and positional requirements. In that sense, it reminds me of the Dragoon a bit, but with its own distinct style on several counts. The Reaper has buffs like arcane crest (which creates a barrier for 10% of HP for you and buffs nearby party members when absorbed), or arcane circle (which buffs party damage). Hellsgate lets you slip in and out of jams, and several abilities have a prerequisite state when casting. At first glance, it doesn’t seem like a beginner class, but should satisfy long-time players immediately. It also looks damn cool, which….c’monnnnnn.</p>

<p>The Sage is the healer class and the other new job for <em>Endwalker</em>. As one of my party members in the demo said, “it’s like they made a Gundam job.” Sage is one of the flashiest jobs in the game, or maybe any <em>Final Fantasy</em> to date. It has myriad area-of-effect (AOE) abilities that fire off cool effects and protect the party, which is especially fun to play when first learning the class. It has some straightforward heals and damage abilities, on top of stuff like Phlegma, which damages enemies and heals your party (provided you hit them with the Kardion-granting Kardia ability). It has a regen (Physis) and a few other tricks up its sleeve, including a mass AOE heal that’s on a 60-second cooldown.</p>
<p>While Reaper is easily more enticing, Sage is something I can see sinking my teeth into across the length of the expansion.</p>
<p>I doubt many of you were worried about the quality of <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker</em>, but based on what I’ve seen, it’s on track to at least meet the high bar they’ve set so far. <em>Shadowbringers</em> is going to be really hard to top, but they’re on the right track.</p>

An Endwalker hands-on preview
[This Endwalker hands-on preview is based on an in-development build of Final Fantasy XIV, and content in the final version is subject to change.]
I’ve been playing Final Fantasy XIV for roughly 11 years. Well, I’ve been enjoying Final Fantasy XIV for X years after the Realm Reborn salvaging job came about. And it’s been pretty crazy to see all of its improvements happen in real-time. Yes, Realm Reborn was pretty great at launch, but it’s gotten so much better since then. That includes the upcoming expansion. It’s time for an Endwalker hands-on preview.

Square Enix gave us nearly a full day of hands-on time with Endwalker. But before that happened, we got a special presentation from Naoki “Yoshi P” Yoshida himself. It was 45 minutes long. He was rocking a soul patch. Ah, the world of MMO coverage! I wouldn’t trade it for anything.
Yoshida says that although he would have loved to have done an in-person preview this year, it’s basically impossible, noting that Japan is still in a “tough situation,” and he took some time to commend the healthcare industry for allowing his team to continue their work. It’s a bizarre time for both press and developers alike, but it was great to see a heartfelt message from Yoshida, as he’s always been earnest throughout his career, and seems like he actually enjoys his work.
After that brief intro, it was time to get to the content. With music from the expansion blaring in the background, Yoshida gave us his spiel. Final Fantasy XIV is now officially at 24 million players, an increase of two million since the last time he checked in, and the game “continues to grow.” Remember when I smack-talked the original version earlier? Yoshida touched on that, noting that it’s amazing how he and his team were able to turn the game around to a “core part of Square Enix’s business” from what it was.

It’s been 11 years since they dropped the 1.0 edition, and on September 30, they’ll hit 12 years and four expansions to Realm Reborn. Yoshida thanks fans for sticking with the game for this long — something he tries to do a couple of times a year, at least — and credits the community for keeping the game alive. Again, I believe his sincerity here.
He recalls how the game grew from four million members after the launch of Heavensward (the first expansion), and how they were “super happy” with that figure because of how they were able to fix the game from its previous state. After Stormblood hit, they grew from 10 million to 16 million before Shadowbringers arrived. The next milestone was surpassed by the “highly acclaimed” Shadowbringers, which now sits at 24 million players. Yoshida vaguely mentioned “10 more years” of plans, and that just because the first saga (Hydaelyn and Zodiark) is over, it doesn’t mean the end.
Onto Endwalker, which is still being referred to as their “largest expansion to date” — which he clarifies is both story and playable content. To recap, there’s six areas, a new hub city, two new jobs (Reaper/Sage), better Trust (CPU party members) AI, new gear/crafting recipes, the Pandemonium raid, a new alliance raid (Myths of the Realm), new dungeons, male Viera race, Island Sanctuary (“relaxed content”), a new tribe (Loporrits), the new data center travel system, the new Oceania region data center, the Ishgard residential district, and a level cap increase to 90.
“More than anything,” he believes people are interested in the new jobs.

Yoshida reiterates from patch 6.1, “a new adventure will begin,” so expect a big finish in the base expansion, as they “tie up loose ends from the last 10 years.” Afterward, the team decided they wanted to “challenge themselves” with a brand new story, and thus the concept for 6.1 was born.

<h2>Wrath of the Lich King is on top</h2>
<p>Every <em>World of Warcraft</em> player, new or old, has a favorite era. Whether it was the one they played first or the one right before they left: there are a lot of individual, personal stories that were born out of this 14 year old phenomenon.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/burning-crusade-is-still-the-greatest-world-of-warcraft-expansion-but-you-can-weigh-in-on-second-place-here-518586.phtml"">I polled our community directly</a> to get a definitive answer on how each expansion measures up, and as far as the absolute top and bottom choices go, it went pretty much how I expected.</p>
<p><sub>[Note: All of these are screenshots of my various characters throughout my 14 year stint with <em>WoW</em>.]</sub></p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/518928_ABBA-noscale.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<p><strong>37.6% – <em>Wrath of the Lich King </em>(2008)</strong></p>
<p>Whenever I ask people what their favorite <em>World of Warcraft</em> expansion is in person, the answer is almost always “<em>Wrath of the Lich King</em>.”</p>
<p>It came at the perfect time: four years into <em>WoW</em>. Four years of “man did you hear about that virus epidemic that was studied by real scientists?” Four years of commercials. Years of friends telling people “you had to play it.” All of that hype and the focus on the formidable Lich King, coupled with a slow shift into making W<em>orld of Warcraft</em> a less hardcore-tinted experience allowed <em>Wrath</em> to explode the way it did. For many it was peak <em>WoW</em>, with some of the most engaging story-rich zones in the game, as well as the introduction of the phasing system, which enhanced quests by drastically altering zones based on where the player was in the narrative.</p>
<p>It might go down as the greatest MMO expansion of all time.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/518928_CC-noscale.jpg?resize=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<p><strong>23.25% – <em>Burning Crusade </em>(2007)</strong></p>
<p>I made it no secret that <em>Burning Crusade</em> was my personal favorite, and I’m glad to see that it at least commands second place all these years later.</p>
<p>The addition of two new races into the fold (Draenei and Blood Elves, the two main races I still play today) was a nice little extra for an expansion, as was the shift to a more focused narrative that pitted us against the Burning Legion — arguably the most formidable faction in the history of the series.</p>
<p>The shift from 40-person raids in Vanilla (which had its own unique feel to it, granted) to 25 (and eventually lower) made a phenomenal difference in making raids more accessible for folks who can’t muster up a ton of players while keeping the difficulty intact. As someone who has raided hardcore throughout roughly half of the game’s lifespan, I found the<em> Burning Crusade</em> era to be the most challenging and rewarding.</p>
<p>That challenge extended to heroic (hard) dungeons as well, as players actually had to make use of all their abilities instead of storming them: a practice introduced in <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> that didn’t really change until the introduction of Mythic dungeons.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/518928_DEA-noscale.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<p><strong>12.49% – <em>Vanilla </em>(2004)</strong></p>
<p>Ah Vanilla: the moniker most people lovingly use when they refer to the original launch of <em>World of Warcraft</em> through the first expansion, <em>Burning Crusade</em>. There’s a lot of reasons why, after all of the advancements Blizzard has made over the years, that folks still hold Vanilla in such high regard.</p>
<p>The easiest way to explain the secret sauce? It was lawless. Lots of things happened that shouldn’t have happened, or otherwise scared away many players. World PVP was rampant and it was common to find “raiding parties” of tons of Alliance or Horde gankers, hell bent on destroying the other faction’s playing experience.</p>
<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1shA5CNtOg"">World bosses were kited (lead) into capital cities</a>. That virus thing I mentioned earlier? It was <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupted_Blood_incident"">the Corrupted Blood Incident</a>, and it was pretty insane. 40-man raids were a trip in and of itself, and when you finally wrangled each and every person into them it was magical. We may never have a popular MMO as laissez faire as Vanilla <em>WoW</em> again.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/518928_EEE-noscale.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<p><strong>9.99% – <em>Legion </em>(2016)</strong></p>
<p>Ah <em>Legion</em>. I was immediately hooked by the continuation (and culmination, basically) of the storyline that began with <em>Burning Crusade</em>. It was a complete and utter follow-up with Illidan at the forefront and plenty of green explosions and paraphernalia.</p>
<p><em>Legion</em> was fueled by the mistakes made in <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, where the development team kind of left the game to its own devices after an explosive launch. It had a ton of support, lots of new mechanics to keep people busy, and some great raids. Suramar, one of the more polarizing areas in recent years, is probably my favorite zone in the game.</p>
<p>Despite the war-torn look the Broken Shore is a beautiful place and I don’t mind replaying it when I’m leveling more characters.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/518928_AAAA-noscale.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<p><strong>7.4% – <em>Battle for Azeroth </em>(2018)</strong></p>
<p>It’s far too early to tell how this one will end up in the pantheon of MMO-dom, but <em>Battle for Azeroth</em> earned a respectable rank roughly in the middle of the road. With two new giant zones that showcase the art team’s talents to their fullest, the whole “Alliance vs. Horde” angle paid off, at least in the sense that it inspired me to play through the campaign with both sides so close to launch: something I rarely, if ever do.</p>
<p>Uldir, its first raid, is a great intro and hopefully one of many to come. Blizzard seems to be on their toes since <em>Draenor</em> and that resplendence might keep <i>Azeroth</i> kicking for some time.

Wrath of the Lich King is on top
Every World of Warcraft player, new or old, has a favorite era. Whether it was the one they played first or the one right before they left: there are a lot of individual, personal stories that were born out of this 14 year old phenomenon.
Several weeks ago I polled our community directly to get a definitive answer on how each expansion measures up, and as far as the absolute top and bottom choices go, it went pretty much how I expected.
[Note: All of these are screenshots of my various characters throughout my 14 year stint with WoW.]

37.6% – Wrath of the Lich King (2008)
Whenever I ask people what their favorite World of Warcraft expansion is in person, the answer is almost always “Wrath of the Lich King.”
It came at the perfect time: four years into WoW. Four years of “man did you hear about that virus epidemic that was studied by real scientists?” Four years of commercials. Years of friends telling people “you had to play it.” All of that hype and the focus on the formidable Lich King, coupled with a slow shift into making World of Warcraft a less hardcore-tinted experience allowed Wrath to explode the way it did. For many it was peak WoW, with some of the most engaging story-rich zones in the game, as well as the introduction of the phasing system, which enhanced quests by drastically altering zones based on where the player was in the narrative.
It might go down as the greatest MMO expansion of all time.

23.25% – Burning Crusade (2007)
I made it no secret that Burning Crusade was my personal favorite, and I’m glad to see that it at least commands second place all these years later.
The addition of two new races into the fold (Draenei and Blood Elves, the two main races I still play today) was a nice little extra for an expansion, as was the shift to a more focused narrative that pitted us against the Burning Legion — arguably the most formidable faction in the history of the series.
The shift from 40-person raids in Vanilla (which had its own unique feel to it, granted) to 25 (and eventually lower) made a phenomenal difference in making raids more accessible for folks who can’t muster up a ton of players while keeping the difficulty intact. As someone who has raided hardcore throughout roughly half of the game’s lifespan, I found the Burning Crusade era to be the most challenging and rewarding.
That challenge extended to heroic (hard) dungeons as well, as players actually had to make use of all their abilities instead of storming them: a practice introduced in Wrath of the Lich King that didn’t really change until the introduction of Mythic dungeons.

12.49% – Vanilla (2004)
Ah Vanilla: the moniker most people lovingly use when they refer to the original launch of World of Warcraft through the first expansion, Burning Crusade. There’s a lot of reasons why, after all of the advancements Blizzard has made over the years, that folks still hold Vanilla in such high regard.
The easiest way to explain the secret sauce? It was lawless. Lots of things happened that shouldn’t have happened, or otherwise scared away many players. World PVP was rampant and it was common to find “raiding parties” of tons of Alliance or Horde gankers, hell bent on destroying the other faction’s playing experience.
World bosses were kited (lead) into capital cities. That virus thing I mentioned earlier? It was the Corrupted Blood Incident, and it was pretty insane. 40-man raids were a trip in and of itself, and when you finally wrangled each and every person into them it was magical. We may never have a popular MMO as laissez faire as Vanilla WoW again.

9.99% – Legion (2016)
Ah Legion. I was immediately hooked by the continuation (and culmination, basically) of the storyline that began with Burning Crusade. It was a complete and utter follow-up with Illidan at the forefront and plenty of green explosions and paraphernalia.
Legion was fueled by the mistakes made in Warlords of Draenor, where the development team kind of left the game to its own devices after an explosive launch. It had a ton of support, lots of new mechanics to keep people busy, and some great raids. Suramar, one of the more polarizing areas in recent years, is probably my favorite zone in the game.
Despite the war-torn look the Broken Shore is a beautiful place and I don’t mind replaying it when I’m leveling more characters.

7.4% – Battle for Azeroth (2018)
It’s far too early to tell how this one will end up in the pantheon of MMO-dom, but Battle for Azeroth earned a respectable rank roughly in the middle of the road. With two new giant zones that showcase the art team’s talents to their fullest, the whole “Alliance vs. Horde” angle paid off, at least in the sense that it inspired me to play through the campaign with both sides so close to launch: something I rarely, if ever do.
Uldir, its first raid, is a great intro and hopefully one of many to come. Blizzard seems to be on their toes since Draenor and that resplendence might keep Azeroth kicking for some time. But with the Burning Legion, so many dead principle characters, and the whole “faction war” angle out of the way, it’s hard to really tell where Blizzard is going to go from there when the next expansion hits in several years (more Old Gods?).

5.26% – Mists of Pandaria (2012)
Here’s where we start dropping into middling territory, which is exactly where I’d place Mists of Pandaria. The community agreed.
There was nothing inherently wrong with Mists. The idea of a neutral starting race (Pandaren), Pokemon (pet) battles, and the Monk class are ripples that are still felt in the game today. Pandaria, the new continent, contains some memorable areas and some great raids.
But at the end of the day it just didn’t do as much as past expansions, with the exception of the much-maligned Cataclysm that came before it. 

3.03% – Cataclysm (2010)
It’s hard to believe that Cataclysm was just the third expansion for World of Warcraft given how much of a drop-off there was. Going with the controversial decision to blow up much of the original world (which caused some Vanilla players to leave immediately), Cataclysm was polarizing from the get-go.
The new Worgen and Goblin races, though hits with some, weren’t quite as popular as others in the past (according to an unofficial census Blood Elves are currently the most popular race in the game even after their debut in Burning Crusade 12 years ago), and much of Cataclysm‘s gimmick was “hey, what’s old is new again!” It was enough of a bomb in my household to get me to stop playing quite as much for the first time in six years.

0.97% – Warlords of Draenor (2014)
But Catalcysm still has its fans: you can’t really say the same for Warlords of Draenor, which didn’t even rock 1% of the total vote.
I don’t need long to explain where Warlords went wrong. Nearly everything about the expansion was a risk. The time-traveling angle that really messed with the archetypes of several existing characters. The “Garrison” system that many referred to as “Farmville in WoW.” It had its detractors on day one, but the long term support is really what killed its legacy, and even somewhat tarnished Blizzard’s image as a whole.
Warlords was so poorly supported post-launch that Blizzard has openly admitted (including to me in-person, multiple times) that they messed up. Unless something really catastrophic happens at Blizzard, Warlords might end up being the all-time low point of the series.

<h2>It’s also one of the most accessible games available</h2>
<p>I’m not sure I needed two more versions of <em>The Last of Us</em>, but here we are. Back in 2014 when the PS4 remaster came out I had little interest in playing it again, as it was just too soon. But eight years is a long time, and a lot of folks probably are interested in another go-around. <em>Last of Us Part 1</em> is now the best way to facilitate that.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Last-of-Us-1.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""Last of Us Part 1 2"" /></p>
<p>Due out on September 2 on PS5 and at a later date on PC, <em>The Last of Us Part 1</em> is a juiced-up remake, taking the PS4 version even further with redone visuals and tons of toggles/options. It’s essentially the same game with some bells and whistles — and the same story beats and characterizations.</p>
<p>Playing through it, I found that the visual makeover was a nice bonus (mostly from a performance point of view), but it didn’t fundamentally alter my experience with <em>The Last of Us</em>. The first 15 minutes or so remain one of the most captivating portions of the game, and the new visuals definitely help get the point across, coupled with top-notch performances. You can see the enhancements for yourself in the video below.</p>
<p>As a note, this edition also comes with the <em>Left Behind </em>DLC, which is just as well since this “Part 1” repack is $70. You can select it immediately from the start (which is nice for folks who already played the original sans DLC and may want to dive in here for the first time). <em>Left Behind</em> is also treated as a separate game of sorts with unique save files.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/e4wiOvgqHQk?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>From a visual standpoint, there are a lot of comprehensive sliders, allowing you to toggle a host of options like HDR and separate technical modes, which target 40 FPS at 4K (fidelity), or dynamic resolution at 60 FPS (performance). I’m going to be real here: some of the character model changes <em>don’t really bother me</em>. I never really connected with some of this cast in the first place, so several of these changes don’t move the needle for me either way.</p>
<p>But the accessibility menu (menus, really) is the crown jewel here, and if you’ve ever played <em>Last of Us</em> but disliked one particular aspect of it, you can basically <a href=""https://blog.playstation.com/2022/08/26/the-last-of-us-part-i-full-list-of-accessibility-features/"" target=""_blank"">customize it out of existence</a> with the PS5 version. I feel like the past few years have been the “era of the toggle,” and it’s been great. There’s fully customizable controls, as well as visual aid, motion sickness, and sound considerations. That latter part is pretty important to showcase, as <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/last-of-us-part-i-dialogue-haptic-audio-feedback-dualsense-controller/"" target=""_blank"">the DualSense can play dialogue via haptic feedback</a> [rumbling]. As far as extras go, there’s concept art, a character model viewer, video galleries, and skin/filter/speedrun/commentary options.</p>
<p>There’s more widespread accessibility options like screen readers and navigation assistance, all the way down to awareness indicators and auto pick-up options. Preset control schemes are available, but you can swap everything around at will. The HUD can be customized, motion sickness can be curbed, and you can even enhance the listening mode range and add infinite underwater breathing. Even enemy accuracy, aggression, damage, resource/ammo quanitity, and stealth can be manipulated individually. If you were ever frustrated with any aspect of the gameplay in the past, you can likely change it.</p>

<p>If you’ve already experienced this story and said “I’m good,” you probably don’t need to pick up <em>Last of Us Part 1</em>. The fanatics who played it 10 or more times already probably had this pre-ordered already. That leaves the most important group: total newcomers. While <em>The Last of Us</em> still has some of the same issues the original debuted with in 2013, the PS5 version (and likely the upcoming PC port, <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/spider-man-pc-steam-impressions-review/"" target=""_blank"">based on Sony’s past efforts</a>) is the best way to play it to date.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.

In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.
The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.

For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.

<h2>An indie juggernaut that won’t leave our collective consciousness</h2>
<p>Where do I start with <em>Stardew Valley</em>? Writing about it in any way feels like a huge undertaking — from my own deeply personal experiences to its being the unofficial face of indie game success stories, I could probably fill volumes.</p>
<p>But in an attempt to hone in my focus, I wanted to start with something that amazes me every time I see it — the fact that five years after its release, an indie game is still making the news on a weekly basis, despite the fact that it’s technically not live service.</p>
<p>Just last week, <em>Stardew</em> <em>Valley </em>was all over the headlines for its new availability on Game Pass starting <a href=""https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/08/10/icymi-twitchgaming-showcase-idxbox/"" target=""_blank"">this fall</a>. I’m honestly not surprised by this in the slightest, because it seems like a perfect candidate to fit the Game Pass formula. It’s the kind of game that you can pick up at any point and have a good time. I already own <em>Stardew</em> on four different platforms, and if I had an Xbox One I’d likely play it on there, too.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021081715575500_s.jpg?resize=640%2C360"" alt=""Reeling in a fish from the ocean"" /></p>
<p>Then there’s the fact that even when the news has nothing to do with <em>Stardew</em> itself getting an update or coming to new platforms, its name is still evoked by games journalists everywhere. Every time a new indie game comes out that has an 8-bit art style, has a farming mechanic, or vaguely resembles one aspect of <em>Stardew Valley</em> in any possible way, everyone is explaining what this new game is like based on how similar it is or isn’t to the legendary farming and community sim.</p>
<p>I think in the same way that any and every game that had remotely difficult gameplay got compared to <em>Dark Souls</em> to the point of beating a dead horse, the exact same thing is happening with <em>Stardew</em>. It feels slightly unfair to these new games that they always have to be fielded through the lens of another game, but I understand why they do it — with something that’s as widespread and well-known as <em>Stardew</em>, it’s an easy point of comparison to use to quickly get someone to understand what they’re in for.</p>

<p>For as wildly popular as <em>Stardew Valley</em> is, I’m honestly shocked it has stayed relatively contained to the base game. Even with the addition of the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stardew-valley-is-getting-co-op-console-versions-and-a-new-content-update/"">co-op mode</a>, basically the only thing that changes is having more than one player character in the mix. In order to stay relevant, a lot of franchises have to add seemingly endless amounts of DLC, or spin off into other genres entirely — <em>Minecraft</em> is a perfect example of that.</p>
<p>But <em>Stardew</em> has managed to <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/indie-darling-stardew-valley-passes-one-million-sales/"">achieve the same level of ubiquity</a> without straying too far from its developer’s original vision. You also have games like <em>Undertale</em>, but its gameplay, subject matter, and style are more niche and off-the-wall, so it hasn’t been able to break into the mainstream in quite the same way.</p>
<p>So many games these days, especially AAA, struggle with having too many cooks in the kitchen during their development, and the final product ends up being a sludge of overused tropes and mechanics of what executives think will sell. I feel like most people know this already, but if for some reason you missed it — the entirety of <em>Stardew Valley</em> was made by one guy, who goes by the screen name ConcernedApe. According to the chapter devoted to his work on making the game in Jason Schrier’s book <em>Blood, Sweat, and Pixels: The Triumphant, Turbulent Stories</em>, it nearly killed him because it was so grueling.</p>

<p>While it hurts my heart to know he struggled so much to make <em>Stardew</em> happen (trust me, I’ve been there), I don’t think it was all in vain. Because he was the only one working on it, he didn’t ever have to compromise his vision. To me, that shines through when I play the game — every mechanic and interaction feels like it has its own personality, which is what draws me into the experience time and time again.</p>
<p>This points to what made <em>Stardew Valley </em>special in the first place, and the reason I think it will never truly go away — the fact that we as players can really feel the passion that continues to go into this project to this day.

An indie juggernaut that won’t leave our collective consciousness
Where do I start with Stardew Valley? Writing about it in any way feels like a huge undertaking — from my own deeply personal experiences to its being the unofficial face of indie game success stories, I could probably fill volumes.
But in an attempt to hone in my focus, I wanted to start with something that amazes me every time I see it — the fact that five years after its release, an indie game is still making the news on a weekly basis, despite the fact that it’s technically not live service.

<p><em>Resident Evil 3</em> — a remake of the 1999 PlayStation title <em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em> — was something of a no-brainer after the incredible success of 2019’s <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-resident-evil-2-2019/"" target=""_blank""><em>Resident Evil 2</em> remake</a>, which itself has shifted an enormous 9.3 million units.

		<h2>CMA filings show how the Activision Blizzard deal could help build the Xbox mobile store</h2>
<p>Amid investigations over Microsoft’s <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-purchase-acquisition-call-of-duty-warcraft/"" target=""_blank"">possible acquisition</a> of Activision Blizzard, new details have emerged about its plans for a mobile store to compete with other platforms.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal is <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-under-uk-regulator-investigation-news/"" target=""_blank"">under investigation</a> by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).

Building on Activision Blizzard’s existing communities of gamers, Xbox will seek to scale the Xbox Store to mobile, attracting gamers to a new Xbox Mobile Platform. Shifting consumers away from the Google Play Store and App Store on mobile devices will, however, require a major shift in consumer behavior. Microsoft hopes that by offering well-known and popular content, gamers will be more inclined to try something new.”</p></blockquote>

Microsoft has been pushing more and more into the mobile market. Putting its cloud gaming service on phones makes for pretty good reasons to pick up a controller clip and game on the go.
But this new development could see Microsoft opening its own platform, one that would compete with Google’s Play Store and the App Store.

Microsoft may be about to reap the financial reward from owning some of the most successful video game series of all time, but it now has a moral obligation — a duty — to repair the studio’s broken reputation and ensure the safety, security, and well-being of Activision Blizzard’s team of employees.
This purchase cannot simply be a (very expensive) coat of paint.

<h2>Tom &amp; Scary</h2>
<p>Warner Bros Games’ fun platform scrapper<em> MultiVersus</em> has received a fresh update, bringing with it a selection of gameplay tweaks, some spooky-ooky Halloween content, and a brand new character in the form of the vicious and malevolent gremlin, Stripe.</p>
<p>Version 1.04, now available on PC and console platforms, sees Stripe join the star-studded roster <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-stripe-gremlins-teaser-fighting-games-dlc-season-one/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=multiversus-stripe-gremlins-teaser-fighting-games-dlc-season-one"" target=""_blank"">as one of Season 1’s additional characters</a>. Wielding a chainsaw and crossbow, the Assassin class fighter will utilize speed and power in lieu of health and defensive abilities. The little bastard is a pretty frightening opponent, and Gizmo better ensure that he’s stocked up on flaming Tippex to take this punk down.</p>

<p>And speaking of frightening, the new update includes a selection of Halloween-themed Elite skins for some of the <em>MultiVersus</em> roster. These include a Mummified Reindog, a super-cute Witch Velma, vampire skins for Tom &amp; Jerry, Frankenstein Iron Giant, Calico Cake, and creepy Black Lantern variants of DC Comics heroes Superman and Wonder Woman. They all look pretty awesome, to be honest, and can be picked up for between 800-1500 Gleamium each.</p>

<p>In addition to the skins, <em>MultiVersus</em> will be holding a special Halloween event between October 15 and November 15. During this time, all players can earn “Candy” in matches, which can be saved and spent on various creepy emotes, stickers, and avatars. If there’s nothing that takes your fancy, then the accrued Candy can be exchanged for Gold in the<em> MultiVersus</em> store. The Mummy Reindog skin can also be purchased via Candy, though it will take a hefty 3000 pieces.</p>

<p>Under the hood, the new update contains additional balance tweaks and bug fixes. Perhaps most notably, the player will now receive a Move Decay penalization after three consecutive uses of an attack (down from four). Player First Games hopes that this will encourage more experimentation in character combo routes.

Warner Bros Games’ fun platform scrapper MultiVersus has received a fresh update, bringing with it a selection of gameplay tweaks, some spooky-ooky Halloween content, and a brand new character in the form of the vicious and malevolent gremlin, Stripe.

<h2>The long road ahead</h2>
<p>CD Projekt published a series of informational slides on Twitter today, alongside a YouTube video, outlining its future plans for the company and its brands, including <em>The Witcher</em> and <em>Cyberpunk</em>.</p>
<p>At the outset, CD Projekt says it plans to expand its online presence and build out both <em>The Witcher </em>and <em>Cyberpunk </em>franchises through “core gaming extensions” (like mobile) and partnerships, including TV series and merchandise. The publisher also says it plans to move into parallel AAA game development <a href=""https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1376923570287353859"" target=""_blank"">starting in 2022</a>. The company has <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1376924349140205575"">also invested in Digital Scrapes</a>, a Vancouver-based studio that will bolster its other studios.</p>

<p>“We are planning to build cross-functional teams to work on both IPs,” said Pawl Zawodny, Head of Production and CTO at CD Projekt, <a href=""https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1376923510216536065/"" target=""_blank"">in one slide</a>. “These teams will blend disciplines and expertise, so we have closer communication and skill sharing going on from the beginning. Cross-functional teams allow different aspects of development to run in tandem without complication.”</p>
<p>As for 2021, CD Projekt is planning on patches, updates, and free DLC for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, alongside the forthcoming next-gen update. On <em>The Witcher </em>side, <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt </em>will receive a next-gen update, <em>Gwent </em>will continue to receive development, and there’s also <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/the-witcher-monster-slayer-is-a-pokemon-go-like-mobile-ar-game-601727.phtml"" target=""_blank""><em>The Witcher: Monster Slayer </em>in the pipeline</a>.</p>
<p>CD Projekt also seems to be responding to some of the critcisms surrounding the development and launch of <em>Cyberpunk 2077.</em> <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-16/cyberpunk-2077-what-caused-the-video-game-s-disastrous-rollout"" target=""_blank"">Reports of crunch circled around <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>‘s launch</a>, as did grievances over the state of the game at launch.</p>

<p>In the video update, CD Projekt highlighted further support for employees, including mental health. “We want to continuously improve the working environment for every team member,” said CD Projekt boss Adam KiciÅ„ski. “We want a sharper focus on how we work together to make great games.”</p>
<p>Executive Michal Nowakowski also said that the company has learned from its marketing and PR campaigns for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. “Going forward, our campaigns will be much shorter,” said Nowakowski. “We will wait until much closer to a game’s launch before we start showing things like trailers, demos, or going in-depth about mechanics, etc.”</p>
<p>Whether all of this can right the ship after the <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/the-upcoming-cyberpunk-2077-1-2-patch-has-over-100-fixes-624239.phtml"" target=""_blank"">still-lingering backlash over </a><em><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/the-upcoming-cyberpunk-2077-1-2-patch-has-over-100-fixes-624239.phtml"" target=""_blank"">Cyberpunk 2077</a></em><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/the-upcoming-cyberpunk-2077-1-2-patch-has-over-100-fixes-624239.phtml"" target=""_blank""></a>, it certainly looks like CD Projekt is forging ahead either way.

<h2>Farm, craft, and hang out with Disney and Pixar pals</h2>
<p>A new competitor in the life simulator genre is bringing some Disney magic. Gameloft has announced <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>, a new life sim adventure for PC, Mac, and consoles set in the magical world of Disney and Pixar.</p>
<p><em>Dreamlight Valley </em>looks to have a little bit of everything, from traditional adventures and hanging out with characters to farming, crafting, and cooking. Players can make customizable avatars and restore a village in the titular Dreamlight Valley.</p>
<p>Along the way, different Disney and Pixar characters will be able to join in and hang out. Building friendships with Disney characters seems like a core part of the game, populating the village as more of it is restored.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/KUl5sWbOinY?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>There are realms to explore featuring various movies. And it looks like the activities can involve certain characters too. In the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUl5sWbOinY"" target=""_blank"">trailer above</a>, you can see Wall-E helping with the garden, Goofy fishing, and Remy getting a whiff of the character’s cooking.</p>
<h2>Life in Magic Kingdom</h2>
<p>It seems a bit like <em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stardew-valley-incredible-staying-power/"">Stardew Valley</a> </em>meets Disney, which isn’t a bad pitch. Putting all these familiar faces in a world where you can roam around and hang out seems like an obvious fit.</p>
<p>Seeing how the story sections of <em>Dreamlight Valley </em>play out will be neat too. The <a href=""https://blog.playstation.com/2022/04/27/disney-dreamlight-valley-launches-on-ps5-and-ps4-in-2022/"" target=""_blank"">PlayStation Blog</a> mentions a story-driven campaign. Characters seem to get their own story arc, with exploration, gift-giving, and side activities built around getting to know them.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DisneyDreamlightValley_Garden_042722.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" alt /></p>
<p>A family-friendly Disney theme park approach to a <em>Stardew</em>-type game seems pretty alright to me. The customizable avatar aspect is a smart choice too, letting players make their own persona in-game. Really, I’m just psyched for any game where I can cook with Remy from <em>Ratatouille</em>.</p>
<p><em>Disney Dreamlight Valley </em>hits early access this summer, via a Founder’s Pack or Xbox Game Pass. It’s set to launch into free-to-play sometime next year.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Jhfofq-ehw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

There are realms to explore featuring various movies. And it looks like the activities can involve certain characters too. In the trailer above, you can see Wall-E helping with the garden, Goofy fishing, and Remy getting a whiff of the character’s cooking.
Life in Magic Kingdom
It seems a bit like Stardew Valley meets Disney, which isn’t a bad pitch. Putting all these familiar faces in a world where you can roam around and hang out seems like an obvious fit.
Seeing how the story sections of Dreamlight Valley play out will be neat too. The PlayStation Blog mentions a story-driven campaign. Characters seem to get their own story arc, with exploration, gift-giving, and side activities built around getting to know them.

A family-friendly Disney theme park approach to a Stardew-type game seems pretty alright to me. The customizable avatar aspect is a smart choice too, letting players make their own persona in-game. Really, I’m just psyched for any game where I can cook with Remy from Ratatouille.
Disney Dreamlight Valley hits early access this summer, via a Founder’s Pack or Xbox Game Pass. It’s set to launch into free-to-play sometime next year.


 


						
	
		Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs
Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.
The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.

In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.
The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.

For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.

<h2>Nearly 1,000 have reportedly signed</h2>
<p>Activision Blizzard employees have circulated and signed a letter to leaders at the company, calling the response to the recent discrimination lawsuit filed against the company “abhorrent and insulting.”</p>
<p>According to <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/activision-blizzard-staff-sign-petition-192031593.html"" target=""_blank"">Bloomberg</a>, which reviewed a company of the letter (as did <a href=""https://kotaku.com/over-1-000-activision-blizzard-employees-sign-letter-co-1847364340"" target=""_blank"">Kotaku</a> and <a href=""https://www.polygon.com/22594765/activision-blizzard-open-letter-harassment-lawsuit"" target=""_blank"">Polygon</a>), the letter has nearly 1,000 signatures and was circulated Monday. Last week, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-toxic-workplace-allegations-california/"" target=""_blank"">filed a suit against Activision Blizzard</a> alleging sexual discrimination and harassment at the company.</p>
<p>A subsequent response from an Activision Blizzard spokesperson said the DFEH’s lawsuit contains “distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard’s past.”</p>
<p>Blizzard president J Allen Brack <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/blizzard-californian-harassment-discrimination-lawsuit-brack-memo/"" target=""_blank"">released a public statement</a> saying that while he couldn’t comment on the specifics of the case, he could say that “the behavior detailed in the allegations is completely unacceptable.” In an email to staff obtained last week by Bloomberg’s <a href=""https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1418619091515068421"" target=""_blank"">Jason Schreier</a>, Activision Blizzard executive vice president Frances Townsend said the lawsuit presented a “distorted and untrue” portrayal of the company, with “factually incorrect, old, and out of context stories” in it.</p>
<p>Some Activision Blizzard employees have been denouncing the statements on social media (via <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/activision-blizzard-employees-denounce-corporate-statements-we-are-here-angry-and-not-so-easily-silenced/"" target=""_blank"">PC Gamer</a>), and in this new letter, the signing employees call for leadership to recognize the “seriousness of these allegations and demonstrate compassion for victims of harassment and assault.”</p>
<p>“Our company executives have claimed that actions will be taken to protect us, but in the face of legal action—and the troubling official responses that followed—we no longer trust that our leaders will place employee safety above their own interests,” the letter reads. “To claim this is a ‘truly meritless and irresponsible lawsuit,’ while seeing so many current and former employees speak out about their own experiences regarding harassment and abuse, is simply unacceptable.”</p>
<p>We have reached out to Activision Blizzard for comment.</p>
<p>A full transcript of the letter, via Bloomberg, follows below:</p>
<blockquote><p>To the Leaders of Activision Blizzard,</p>
<p>We, the undersigned, agree that the statements from Activision Blizzard, Inc. and their legal counsel regarding the DFEH lawsuit, as well as the subsequent internal statement from Frances Townsend, are abhorrent and insulting to all that we believe our company should stand for. To put it clearly and unequivocally, our values as employees are not accurately reflected in the words and actions of our leadership.</p>
<p>We believe these statements have damaged our ongoing quest for equality inside and outside of our industry. Categorizing the claims that have been made as “distorted, and in many cases false” creates a company atmosphere that disbelieves victims. It also casts doubt on our organizations’ ability to hold abusers accountable for their actions and foster a safe environment for victims to come forward in the future. These statements make it clear that our leadership is not putting our values first. Immediate corrections are needed from the highest level of our organization. Our company executives have claimed that actions will be taken to protect us, but in the face of legal action—and the troubling official responses that followed—we no longer trust that our leaders will place employee safety above their own interests. To claim this is a “truly meritless and irresponsible lawsuit,” while seeing so many current and former employees speak out about their own experiences regarding harassment and abuse, is simply unacceptable.</p>
<p>We call for official statements that recognize the seriousness of these allegations and demonstrate compassion for victims of harassment and assault. We call on Frances Townsend to stand by her word to step down as Executive Sponsor of the ABK Employee Women’s Network as a result of the damaging nature of her statement. We call on the executive leadership team to work with us on new and meaningful efforts that ensure employees—as well as our community—have a safe place to speak out and come forward.</p>
<p>We stand with all our friends, teammates, and colleagues, as well as the members of our dedicated community, who have experienced mistreatment or harassment of any kind. We will not be silenced, we will not stand aside, and we will not give up until the company we love is a workplace we can all feel proud to be a part of again. We will be the change.</p></blockquote>

Revealed directly after he stopped doing the “daily Smash Ultimate screen” tweets
Just this week, we were reminded by Super Smash Bros. boss Masahiro Sakurai that the “daily Smash screens” fun was coming to an end. On August 22, 2023, the dream was over, and the last screen was posted. But the beloved designer had another trick up his sleeve: an entire YouTube channel! The era of Sakurai YouTube has begun.

The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.

<h2>Isaac will stomp some Necromorphs again in 2023</h2>
<p>The <em>Dead Space </em>team held another <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAXLkdbSiVg"" target=""_blank"">live stream</a> today, talking more about the upcoming remake. And as part of the news, EA Motive confirmed the <em>Dead Space </em>remake now has a release date of Jan. 27, 2023.</p>
<p>Since the remake was announced <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dead-space-remake-ea-motive-reveal-news/"" target=""_blank"">last year</a>, the crew at EA Motive have been steadily providing updates on their progress. The last stream, in March, was <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dead-space-remake-aiming-for-early-2023-launch-news/"" target=""_blank"">all about the audio</a> of <em>Dead Space</em>. Today’s livestream went for the visual instead, <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dead-space-remake-art-stream-may-12-lighting-environments-characters-vfx/"" target=""_blank"">focusing on the art</a> of <em>Dead Space</em>.</p>
<p>The presentation went fairly in-depth, and showed off a bunch of the ways they’re re-tuning the original 2008 survival horror game for modern systems. It goes through Motive’s work on environments, visual effects, character models, and lighting effects. Volumetric fog sure seems like a good way to make the USG Ishimura even scarier.</p>

<h2>A new frontier</h2>
<p>The <em>Dead Space </em>remake was first revealed during <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dead-space-remake-ea-motive-reveal-news/"" target=""_blank"">last year’s EA Play Live showcase</a>. The undertaking is being handled by EA Motive, which collaborated on <em>Star Wars Battlefront II </em>and developed <em>Star Wars: Squadrons</em>.</p>
<p>To its credit, Motive has been pretty open in showing off early builds of the remake and taking fans through the development process. These livestreams are usually pretty long, but also very in-depth. The studio has also responded to feedback throughout the process, like <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dead-space-remake-revises-plasma-cutter-audio-after-fan-feedback-before-and-after/"" target=""_blank"">tuning the audio on the signature Plasma Cutter</a> after fans pointed out some quirks.</p>
<p>Remaking a game as memorable as <em>Dead Space </em>is a big task, but Motive at least seems like it’s tackling things head-on, and that January 2023 release date isn’t too far away, either. Meanwhile, some of the minds behind the original <em>Dead Space </em>are working on their own project, <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/the-callisto-protocol-is-gonna-remind-you-of-dead-space-in-all-the-best-ways/"" target=""_blank""><em>The Callisto Protocol</em></a>.

<p>Amid investigations over Microsoft’s <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-purchase-acquisition-call-of-duty-warcraft/"" target=""_blank"">possible acquisition</a> of Activision Blizzard, new details have emerged about its plans for a mobile store to compete with other platforms.</p>

As part of those filings, Microsoft says a motivation for the acquisition is to help build out its mobile presence.</p>
<p>Here’s the relevant item from <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/microsoft-slash-activision-blizzard-merger-inquiry"" target=""_blank"">the CMA filing</a>, as reported on by <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/19/23411972/microsoft-xbox-mobile-store-games"" target=""_blank"">The Verge</a>:</p>

Shifting consumers away from the Google Play Store and App Store on mobile devices will, however, require a major shift in consumer behavior. Microsoft hopes that by offering well-known and popular content, gamers will be more inclined to try something new.”</p></blockquote>

Isaac will stomp some Necromorphs again in 2023
The Dead Space team held another live stream today, talking more about the upcoming remake. And as part of the news, EA Motive confirmed the Dead Space remake now has a release date of Jan. 27, 2023.
Since the remake was announced last year, the crew at EA Motive have been steadily providing updates on their progress. The last stream, in March, was all about the audio of Dead Space. Today’s livestream went for the visual instead, focusing on the art of Dead Space.
The presentation went fairly in-depth, and showed off a bunch of the ways they’re re-tuning the original 2008 survival horror game for modern systems. It goes through Motive’s work on environments, visual effects, character models, and lighting effects. Volumetric fog sure seems like a good way to make the USG Ishimura even scarier.

A new frontier
The Dead Space remake was first revealed during last year’s EA Play Live showcase. The undertaking is being handled by EA Motive, which collaborated on Star Wars Battlefront II and developed Star Wars: Squadrons.
To its credit, Motive has been pretty open in showing off early builds of the remake and taking fans through the development process. These livestreams are usually pretty long, but also very in-depth. The studio has also responded to feedback throughout the process, like tuning the audio on the signature Plasma Cutter after fans pointed out some quirks.
Remaking a game as memorable as Dead Space is a big task, but Motive at least seems like it’s tackling things head-on, and that January 2023 release date isn’t too far away, either. Meanwhile, some of the minds behind the original Dead Space are working on their own project, The Callisto Protocol. Sci-fi survival horror is having a bit of a resurgence, and it’s hard not to be excited about it.

Amid investigations over Microsoft’s possible acquisition of Activision Blizzard, new details have emerged about its plans for a mobile store to compete with other platforms.
Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal is under investigation by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). As part of those filings, Microsoft says a motivation for the acquisition is to help build out its mobile presence.
Here’s the relevant item from the CMA filing, as reported on by The Verge:
“The transaction will improve Microsoft’s ability to create a next generation game store which operates across a range of devices, including mobile as a result of the addition of Activision Blizzard’s content.

Microsoft hopes that by offering well-known and popular content, gamers will be more inclined to try something new.”

A more mobile Xbox
Microsoft has been pushing more and more into the mobile market. Putting its cloud gaming service on phones makes for pretty good reasons to pick up a controller clip and game on the go.
But this new development could see Microsoft opening its own platform, one that would compete with Google’s Play Store and the App Store.
Mobile gaming revenue from Activision Blizzard is strong, as Microsoft notes in the filing. The output of the King side of Activision Blizzard, alongside games like Call of Duty: Mobile, represent a good chunk of revenue.
The acquisition remains under scrutiny though, as the CMA continues to investigate.
In other Activision Blizzard news, Blizzard Albany workers recently won approval for a union vote.

<p>One upcoming release that Marvel fans have been looking forward to is <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://midnightsuns.2k.com/""><em>Midnight Suns</em></a>, an upcoming tactical RPG by Firaxis Games, a veteran studio best known for creating the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/firaxis-designers-speak-on-civilization-beyond-earth/""><i>Civilization</i> </a>series.

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

Get ready for a new adventure
One upcoming release that Marvel fans have been looking forward to is Midnight Suns, an upcoming tactical RPG by Firaxis Games, a veteran studio best known for creating the Civilization series.

<h2>The Year of Tactics charges forward</h2>
<p>A new tactical RPG from Square Enix is on the way, under a brand-new moniker too. <em>The DioField Chronicle </em>is a new kind of strategy role-playing game, using real-time systems.</p>
<p>Shown at today’s State of Play, <em>The DioField Chronicle </em>definitely has some <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>vibes at first. It’s set in a fantasy world, in the midst of a clash between armies and nations. Soldiers in armor stand around a table, discussing battles.</p>
<p>Where <em>The DioField Chronicle </em>differs looks to be its combat. There’s a real-time approach, rather than the turn-based you’d expect. Square Enix is describing this as the Real-Time Tactical Battle system, or RTTB.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/a_Jnap7qQK8?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>So while it’s got a bit of classic <em>FFT </em>in there, it also feels a little akin to an RTS too. The cut-ins, with stylized portraits and zooms, also bring to mind <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-fire-emblem-three-houses/"" target=""_blank""><em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em></a>. And the maps look to be “boards,” again similar to <em>FFT </em>or more recently, <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/triangle-strategy-review-in-progress-nintendo-switch/"" target=""_blank""><em>Triangle Strategy</em></a>.</p>
<p>I’m pretty interested in this new direction, because it seems pretty novel and different than what you’d usually expect from a tactics game. The tactical RPG genre is having a big year in 2022, with <em>Triangle Strategy </em>just out and games like <em>Front Mission </em>and <em>Midnight Suns </em>on the horizon. But something a little fresh and interesting seems intriguing, too.</p>
<p><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T62KUVFuLwg"" target=""_blank"">The DioField Chronicle</a> </em>is coming to PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam sometime in 2022.</p>

<h2>Average starts at five, not seven</h2>
<p>Hi! I’m Chris Carter, the Reviews Director for Destructoid.com. I’ve been reviewing games professionally for around nine years now. It’s my job to give you an informed opinion of various games out on the market, so you can make a decision on what to spend your money on, or how you choose to spend your afternoons. </p>
<p>By nature, reviews are a subjective beast. They are based on our own individual opinions, and that may not reflect your exact feelings on a game. Best rest assured, we strive for accuracy, and we will do our best to convey why a game made us feel a certain way. It is also our policy to review what’s <em>in</em> the game, and not promises of what may come. We often may speculate on future features or facets of a game through the course of a review, but it will not affect the score.</p>
<p>Let me stress that although we do speak to PR on occasion to obtain advance review copies for games, we do not collude with them, any sponsors, or advertising agencies on anything regarding reviews or scores. Our review team is completely and utterly isolated from the ad team. I have no idea how they conduct their business, and I’d like to keep it that way.</p>
<p><strong>How we score – the Destructoid scale</strong></p>
<p>Here at Destructoid, we use the entire scale. It does not start at “7.” Let me repeat that — if a game is less than “good,” (7) it will be scored as such. Just because a game has obtained a “6” does not mean it’s a “bad,” game — far from it, in fact. If you come into this believing that the only games worth buying are 9’s or 10’s you’re not really understanding what we’re trying to convey. Please take a closer look:</p>
<p><b>10 — Flawless  </b><span>(</span><i>10s aren’t perfect, since nothing is, but they come as close as you could get in a given genre. The new leader to beat in its sector, we’re talking pure ecstasy.</i><span>)</span></p>
<p><b>9 — Superb </b><span>(</span><i>9s are a hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won’t cause massive damage.</i><span>)</span></p>
<p><b>8 — Great</b><span> (</span><i>8s are impressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won’t astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.</i><span>)</span><br /><b><br />7 — Good</b><span> (</span><i>7s are solid and definitely have an audience. There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun.</i><span>)</span><br /><b><br />6 — Alright</b><span> (</span><i>6s may be slightly above average or simply inoffensive. Fans of the genre should enjoy them a bit, but a fair few will be left unfulfilled.</i><span>)</span></p>
<p><b>5 — Mediocre</b><span> (</span><i>5s are an exercise in apathy, neither Solid nor Liquid. Not exactly bad, but not very good either. Just a bit “meh,” really.</i><span>)</span></p>
<p><b>4 — Below Average</b><span> (</span><i>4s have some high points, but they soon give way to glaring faults. Not the worst, but difficult to recommend.</i><span>)</span><br /><b><br />3 — Poor</b><span> (</span><i>3s went wrong somewhere along the line.

Average starts at five, not seven
Hi! I’m Chris Carter, the Reviews Director for Destructoid.com. I’ve been reviewing games professionally for around nine years now. It’s my job to give you an informed opinion of various games out on the market, so you can make a decision on what to spend your money on, or how you choose to spend your afternoons. 
By nature, reviews are a subjective beast. They are based on our own individual opinions, and that may not reflect your exact feelings on a game. Best rest assured, we strive for accuracy, and we will do our best to convey why a game made us feel a certain way. It is also our policy to review what’s in the game, and not promises of what may come. We often may speculate on future features or facets of a game through the course of a review, but it will not affect the score.
Let me stress that although we do speak to PR on occasion to obtain advance review copies for games, we do not collude with them, any sponsors, or advertising agencies on anything regarding reviews or scores. Our review team is completely and utterly isolated from the ad team. I have no idea how they conduct their business, and I’d like to keep it that way.
How we score – the Destructoid scale
Here at Destructoid, we use the entire scale. It does not start at “7.” Let me repeat that — if a game is less than “good,” (7) it will be scored as such. Just because a game has obtained a “6” does not mean it’s a “bad,” game — far from it, in fact. If you come into this believing that the only games worth buying are 9’s or 10’s you’re not really understanding what we’re trying to convey. Please take a closer look:
10 — Flawless  (10s aren’t perfect, since nothing is, but they come as close as you could get in a given genre. The new leader to beat in its sector, we’re talking pure ecstasy.)
9 — Superb (9s are a hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won’t cause massive damage.)
8 — Great (8s are impressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back. Won’t astound everyone, but is worth your time and cash.)7 — Good (7s are solid and definitely have an audience. There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun.)6 — Alright (6s may be slightly above average or simply inoffensive. Fans of the genre should enjoy them a bit, but a fair few will be left unfulfilled.)
5 — Mediocre (5s are an exercise in apathy, neither Solid nor Liquid. Not exactly bad, but not very good either. Just a bit “meh,” really.)
4 — Below Average (4s have some high points, but they soon give way to glaring faults. Not the worst, but difficult to recommend.)3 — Poor (3s went wrong somewhere along the line. The original idea might have promise, but in practice it has failed. Threatens to be interesting sometimes, but rarely.)2 — Bad (2s are a disaster. Any good they might have had are quickly swallowed up by a plethora of issues. The desperate or the gullible may find a glimmer of fun hidden somewhere in the pit.)1 — Failure (1s are the lowest of the low. There is no potential, no depth and no talent. These have nothing to offer the world, and will die lonely and forgotten.)
[Our scores were reverted back to our original system in April 2016, after using altered descriptions for a year.]

<h2>The Crusaders embark for a new realm</h2>
<p>Owlcat Games’ <em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous </em>is making the leap to consoles. The giant RPG will launch on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One both physically and digitally on Sept. 29, as well as Nintendo Switch via cloud.</p>
<p><em>Wrath of the Righteous </em>will also be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, via backward compatibility. Once the console version launches, the Enhanced Edition of <em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous </em>will become the standard version, and PC owners will all get <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1184370/view/3400797688635109882"" target=""_blank"">that version for free on Sept. 29</a>.</p>
<p>Owlcat has also announced that <em>The Treasure of the Midnight Isles</em>, the third DLC for this <em>Pathfinder</em>, launches on August 11. This new adventure heads to the Midnight Isles, where horrors and terrors abound. There’s both a standalone rogue-like mode and campaign option available, allowing players to experiment with builds and party compositions if they’d like. Even if a party dies, its progress can help future playthroughs.</p>

<p><em>The Treasure of the Midnight Isles </em>will be available either as a separate purchase, or as part of the season pass.</p>
<h2>Many stories to tell</h2>
<p><em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous </em>is, by all accounts, a massive RPG. It’s got a <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/isometric-rpgs-are-eating-away-all-of-my-gaming-time/"" target=""_blank"">somewhat-daunting amount</a> of content, not all too dissimilar from other isometric RPGs. But if you’re looking for a console RPG to eat up your time, you could probably do worse. Impressions of the PC version <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/1184370/Pathfinder_Wrath_of_the_Righteous/"" target=""_blank"">seem mostly positive</a>, and there’s even more on the way with the Midnight Isles DLC.</p>
<p>Owlcat, meanwhile, is also forging on to a new franchise. Last month’s <em>Warhammer </em>Skulls festival showcase confirmed that Owlcat is creating a <em>Warhammer 40K </em>CRPG, <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-owlcat-games-rpg-reveal-trailer/"" target=""_blank""><em>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The deal kicks off with the upcoming <em>Iron Man </em>game</h2>
<p>EA and Marvel have locked in a deal for at least three action-adventure games. Electronic Arts will develop the titles, set in the Marvel universe, for PC and console.</p>
<p>The deal was first reported today by <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-31/electronic-arts-strikes-three-game-deal-with-marvel"" target=""_blank"">Bloomberg,</a> followed by an <a href=""https://www.ea.com/en-ca/news/ea-marvel-entertainment-multi-title-collaboration"" target=""_blank"">announcement from EA</a>. Marvel and Electronic Arts will collaborate on “at least three” new action-adventure games, available for PC and console.</p>
<p>These games will be original stories set in the Marvel universe, and we already know about one of them. EA Motive was <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/ea-motive-iron-man-marvel-games-reveal-single-player-action-adventure/"" target=""_blank"">recently confirmed</a> to be working on an <em>Iron Man </em>game.</p>
<p>“At Marvel, we strive to find best-in-class teams who can take our characters on heroic journeys in ways they haven’t before, and collaborating with Electronic Arts will help us achieve that,” said Marvel Games executive VP Jay Ong. “We pride ourselves on being enthusiastic, creative collaborators with developers so they have the freedom to create something deeply unique and truly remarkable. The team at Motive is getting started on that with their <em>Iron Man</em> video game and we can’t wait for players to learn more in the far future.”</p>

The deal kicks off with the upcoming Iron Man game
EA and Marvel have locked in a deal for at least three action-adventure games. Electronic Arts will develop the titles, set in the Marvel universe, for PC and console.
The deal was first reported today by Bloomberg, followed by an announcement from EA. Marvel and Electronic Arts will collaborate on “at least three” new action-adventure games, available for PC and console.
These games will be original stories set in the Marvel universe, and we already know about one of them. EA Motive was recently confirmed to be working on an Iron Man game.
“At Marvel, we strive to find best-in-class teams who can take our characters on heroic journeys in ways they haven’t before, and collaborating with Electronic Arts will help us achieve that,” said Marvel Games executive VP Jay Ong. “We pride ourselves on being enthusiastic, creative collaborators with developers so they have the freedom to create something deeply unique and truly remarkable. The team at Motive is getting started on that with their Iron Man video game and we can’t wait for players to learn more in the far future.”

EA has a history with the Star Wars series already. Games like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order have done pretty well. Well enough, in fact, that Respawn’s working on several more Star Wars projects.
With a Marvel deal locked in, it looks like Electronic Arts is deepening its ties to Disney properties.
The Marvel universe isn’t just stopping there, though. Skydance recently teased its upcoming Captain America-Black Panther project. (Skydance is also working on a Star Wars project.)
Plus, Marvel’s Midnight Suns is just around the corner in December. And Marvel Snap is gradually taking over everyone’s phones. The Marvel games roll-out just keeps growing.

<h2>Long-rumored multi-tier subscription plan might be official “as soon as next week”</h2>
<p>Several months ago, there were rumblings of a new (<a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/sony-playstation-subscription-service-game-pass-competitor-rumored/"" target=""_blank"">but seemingly familiar</a>) PlayStation subscription service with different tiers — you might remember hearing the codename, Spartacus, which has since lived on in forum posts, threads, and comments. <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-25/sony-to-unveil-playstation-subscription-as-soon-as-next-week"" target=""_blank"">According to a Bloomberg report</a>, Sony could announce this expanded service as soon as next week.</p>

<p>But more than just consolidating these current plans, this new service will have “multiple tiers offering catalogs of modern games and classics from older PlayStation eras,” as Bloomberg puts it. And according to sources, we can expect a “splashy lineup of hit games from recent years,” which sure sounds like something Sony would want to lead with.</p>
<p>I’m not expecting anything as comprehensive as Game Pass — and on that front, it sounds like day-one releases for Sony’s big-hitters like <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> aren’t on the table here, per Bloomberg’s sources — so we’ll see. “Extended demos” are potentially interesting as a perk, but I can’t say that’ll move the needle for me, personally.</p>
<p>Of course, for some of us, it’s going to come down to those potential legacy PlayStation games, and how much it’ll cost to play them on a modern platform. Wider access to Sony’s amazing back-catalog is the major piece that’s missing from PlayStation for me right now. As a paying PlayStation Plus member (for I don’t even want to know how many years now), dipping back into the PS1, PS2, and even PS3 library could get me to pay more. <em>Could</em>.

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

<h2>‘Tis the season</h2>
<p>While it’s nice to celebrate Covid cases dropping nationwide, it’s clear that we’re still in the midst of a pandemic. Some things may be slowly returning to normal, but so much of our lives are still not quite the same. Part of me wonders how much will remain changed forever.</p>
<p>Of course, the pandemic has also meant more free time, so just like most people, I’ve spent a lot of my time playing games. I decided to give <i>Call of Duty: Cold War </i>a try last year after being gifted a copy, and I got hooked instantly. Now it’s become one of my go-to pandemic pick-me-ups.</p>
<p>Although I’m still feeling down about certain aspects of lockdown, one thing that has helped me get into the spirit of the season is actually the seasonal event in <i>Cold War,</i> also known as <a href=""https://www.callofduty.com/content/atvi/callofduty/blog/web/en/home/2021/10/call-of-duty-warzone-the-haunting-season-six-halloween-event.html"" target=""_blank""><i>The Haunting</i></a>. This year’s event includes what you’d typically expect: Halloween-themed maps and zombies modes, new multiplayer modes altogether, and of course, lots and lots of skins and cosmetics packs.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5bd4accf27750f8bc8000006.jpeg?resize=640%2C362"" alt=""Halloween game events are annual traditions for multiplayer games like Call of Duty and Overwatch"" /></p>
<p>These Halloween events in games never reinvent the wheel by any means, but I always find them to be a lot of fun. In the same way that others enjoy a pumpkin spice latte, these seasonal events are my favorite because they only come around once a year, and the novelty of them makes them feel special.</p>
<p>I always find these things fascinating from a meta-narrative standpoint. It’s difficult to have a solid through line with live-service games like <i>Call of Duty</i>, <i>Overwatch</i>, or <i>Fortnite</i>, so menus, in-game dialogue, and supplementary materials have to do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to storytelling. For most of the year, these games usually try to keep up various through lines for the characters and world, at least to maintain atmosphere when you’re playing.</p>
<p>I find it hilarious, then, when the holidays come in and kind of mess with that a bit. Take <i>Overwatch</i>, for example. I played this game religiously for a few years when I was in college, and the Halloween event was by far my favorite. Seeing spooky versions of my favorite map was fun, Junkenstein’s Revenge was <i>Overwatch</i>‘s <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatchs-new-co-op-mode-is-a-big-tease-of-what-might-be-coming-down-the-line/"" target=""_blank"">best PvE event</a>, and as a Mercy main, I always looked forward to adorning my witch skin, because it was one of my favorites in the game.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/466320-Header.jpg?resize=640%2C480"" alt=""Witch Mercy in the Overwatch Halloween game event"" /></p>
<p>The funny part was, though, I could see the seams of where the game world had to give a little bit to allow for the Halloween stuff. The Junkenstein game mode was clearly out of character for everyone involved — so what, are we just pretending that these people (and robots) all laid down arms to have some kind of weird role-playing session? Are we supposed to assume this takes place in an alternate universe?</p>
<p>It’s a silly, nitpicky conversation — we all suspend disbelief because it’s just for fun — but I find it fascinating to think about all the same.</p>
<p>Then there’s <i>Call of Duty</i>. It’s a very serious war game about very serious people fighting each other tooth and nail for, like, the fate of humanity or something? I don’t know, I always skip all the cutscenes. Anyway, that’s why I find it so funny to have dudes running around in costumes in the midst of otherwise normal-looking players on normal-looking maps. If I get killed by one more <a href=""https://www.callofduty.com/content/atvi/callofduty/blog/web/en/home/2021/10/black-ops-cold-war-warzone-haunting-scream-operator-bundle-ghostface.html"" target=""_blank"">Ghostface</a> with those wicked-overpowered double shotguns, I’m gonna lose it (aside from my nerd rage, though, it’ll never stop being funny).</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/scream.jpg?resize=640%2C360"" alt=""Scream's Ghostface in Call of Duty"" /></p>
<p>The inherent silliness of these events is kind of what makes them shine, in my opinion, because they’re a great reminder that video games are supposed to be all about having fun in the first place.</p>
<p>Playing these games has helped numb the sting of what we’re missing out on again this year because of the pandemic. At the same time, though, not being out and about as often has made me realize that so much of what I love about the months leading up to a holiday is that I see all kinds of decorations around — at the store, in my neighbors’ yards, in restaurants.</p>
<p>So while I may not have those things around me all the time, I do get on <i>Call of Duty</i> almost every day. I didn’t expect a seasonal event in a game would be the thing to make me feel like Halloween is really here, but it achieved that all the same. It’s a small thing, but having that sense of normalcy, of time passing, makes a huge difference in getting me in the spirit of the season.</p>

In the same way that others enjoy a pumpkin spice latte, these seasonal events are my favorite because they only come around once a year, and the novelty of them makes them feel special.
I always find these things fascinating from a meta-narrative standpoint. It’s difficult to have a solid through line with live-service games like Call of Duty, Overwatch, or Fortnite, so menus, in-game dialogue, and supplementary materials have to do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to storytelling. For most of the year, these games usually try to keep up various through lines for the characters and world, at least to maintain atmosphere when you’re playing.
I find it hilarious, then, when the holidays come in and kind of mess with that a bit. Take Overwatch, for example. I played this game religiously for a few years when I was in college, and the Halloween event was by far my favorite. Seeing spooky versions of my favorite map was fun, Junkenstein’s Revenge was Overwatch‘s best PvE event, and as a Mercy main, I always looked forward to adorning my witch skin, because it was one of my favorites in the game.

The funny part was, though, I could see the seams of where the game world had to give a little bit to allow for the Halloween stuff. The Junkenstein game mode was clearly out of character for everyone involved — so what, are we just pretending that these people (and robots) all laid down arms to have some kind of weird role-playing session? Are we supposed to assume this takes place in an alternate universe?
It’s a silly, nitpicky conversation — we all suspend disbelief because it’s just for fun — but I find it fascinating to think about all the same.
Then there’s Call of Duty. It’s a very serious war game about very serious people fighting each other tooth and nail for, like, the fate of humanity or something? I don’t know, I always skip all the cutscenes. Anyway, that’s why I find it so funny to have dudes running around in costumes in the midst of otherwise normal-looking players on normal-looking maps. If I get killed by one more Ghostface with those wicked-overpowered double shotguns, I’m gonna lose it (aside from my nerd rage, though, it’ll never stop being funny).

The inherent silliness of these events is kind of what makes them shine, in my opinion, because they’re a great reminder that video games are supposed to be all about having fun in the first place.
Playing these games has helped numb the sting of what we’re missing out on again this year because of the pandemic. At the same time, though, not being out and about as often has made me realize that so much of what I love about the months leading up to a holiday is that I see all kinds of decorations around — at the store, in my neighbors’ yards, in restaurants.
So while I may not have those things around me all the time, I do get on Call of Duty almost every day. I didn’t expect a seasonal event in a game would be the thing to make me feel like Halloween is really here, but it achieved that all the same. It’s a small thing, but having that sense of normalcy, of time passing, makes a huge difference in getting me in the spirit of the season.

<h2>It’s coming for us all</h2>
<p>It’s no secret that superhero movies have dominated the box office for over a decade now. It’s also not a secret that a lot of people out there, myself included, have suffered from superhero movie burnout. Things have been winding down in the MCU after <i>Endgame</i>, and DC never really got much of a start to begin with. Now, it seems like Hollywood is running out of comic book material to mine, so they’re moving on to another action-oriented market they haven’t fully tapped into yet: the video game movie.</p>
<p>It seems like a new video game movie or show is being announced <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-third-film-live-action-series-knuckles-streaming-news/"" target=""_blank"">just about every day</a>, and this trend is showing no signs of <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/raw-fury-dj2-film-tv-deal/"" target=""_blank"">slowing down</a>. Games are the natural next step after comic books — they’re usually packed full of exciting fight sequences, and often center around the same fantasy or sci-fi tropes that audiences love. Plus there’s the added bonus of the automatic audience of people who already love the IPs that they’re adapting. It’s the obvious safe choice, something filmmakers gravitate towards every time.</p>

<h3>Working against the past</h3>
<p>But there’s just one problem — video game movies in the past have been notoriously bad, because for whatever reason filmmakers can’t quite seem to hit their stride in translating interactive content to a more linear format. Of course, there have been a few exceptions over the years. The <i>Sonic</i> series has been doing well on the silver screen, but for every success, there are dozens of other failed game-to-film projects. The <i>World of Warcrafts</i>, <i>Assassin’s Creeds</i>, and most recently, <a href=""https://www.escapistmagazine.com/uncharted-movie-review/"" target=""_blank""><i>Uncharteds</i></a> of the world have already telegraphed to the public that video game movies are almost always a letdown.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have shows like <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/it-looks-like-the-second-season-of-the-witcher-show-will-tackle-the-wild-hunt/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Witcher</i></a> and <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/arcane-impressions-the-new-league-of-legends-show-is-surprisingly-really-good/"" target=""_blank""><i>Arcane</i></a> that have done exceptionally well, which provide a little bit more hope. I’m a staunch believer that games should have always been adapted in a serialized format anyway, especially if the creators are going for a 1:1 translation of the story that was originally from the game.</p>
<p>Games already tell their stories in a much longer form than films, so if you want to cut it down to a two-hour runtime rather than a fifteen- to thirty-hour one, creators will need to make a lot of changes.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Arcane-Raise.jpg?resize=640%2C361"" alt=""Arcane"" /></p>
<p>I’m all for changes, though, when they can add to the experience. <i>Arcane</i> was set in the world of <i>League of Legends</i>, but expanded upon that world in a way that players and viewers hadn’t seen before. Trying to make an exact TV version of <i>League of Legends</i> would have been kind of ridiculous given that it’s not a story-driven game, but the end result of <i>Arcane</i> is a good case study in how taking an idea and transforming it into something new (aka the whole point of adapting something to a new medium) is what will make the project shine the most.</p>
<h2>Putting a new spin on the classics</h2>
<p>This is especially true of games where the performances are their most iconic feature. It’s what makes me most hesitant about HBO’s adaptation of <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-series-production-still-tv/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Last of Us</i></a> — Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson <i>are </i>Joel and Ellie. They put so much of themselves into those characters, which means the new cast has some big shoes to fill. Those story moments are punctuated with such specific emotional beats from the actors, which were so perfectly captured by the animation — just try and tell me that the last shot of Ellie’s face when she says “okay” isn’t one of the most iconic and recognizable in all of gaming.</p>
<p>For me, the only way that the <i>Last of Us </i>show can see success is if those in charge of creating it lean into Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey’s respective takes on Joel, Ellie, and the relationship between them rather than trying to perfectly recreate moments from the game.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/the_last_of_us_ending.jpg?resize=640%2C360"" alt=""Ellie from The Last of Us"" /></p>
<p>Netflix’s newly confirmed <i>BioShock</i> movie will have a similar problem; it also contains some of the most iconic performances in games history. It also has the additional problem of using more gaming conventions to convey its narrative than <i>The Last of Us </i>does, specifically through the radio. Having the player receive so much of the game’s story content through a radio that plays as they explore was a smart way to keep the player engaged in the narrative, and although it’s not impossible, I think it will be pretty difficult to keep the viewer engaged in the same way while also not giving up the twist right away.</p>
<p>I think the thing I find most frustrating about all of these adaptations is that they mostly just don’t need to happen, not really. In theory, it’s really cool to think of seeing some of my favorite stories in a new light — the abstract, nebulous idea of seeing a stylized, well-produced new take on <i>BioShock </i>or <i>Portal</i> is something I’m <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dream-video-game-tv-show-adaptations-list/"" target=""_blank"">ravenous for.</a></p>
<h2>If you’re gonna do it, do it right</h2>
<p>I can’t know for sure why Hollywood keeps getting this stuff wrong, but my guess is that they don’t understand how the interactivity of games makes them unique. It’s an entirely different set of rules of how you tell a story, and that can be much more difficult to understand when one doesn’t have a grasp on the medium in the first place. Any old film executive understands how a book works, but I can bet that plenty of them have never even played a video game before.</p>
<p>My only hope is that these studios continue to incorporate lots of people from the games industry who can help bridge that gap, and that they try to capture the spirit of what made the original fun rather than just copy and pasting story beats.</p>
<p>For now I will remain skeptical, so that when a good video game movie does come out, I can be pleasantly surprised, rather than let down yet again.</p>

<p>Something<em> very</em> special from the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster takes time out from its recent Namco obsession to deliver not only a Tecmo title, but a fun, silly, and particularly obscure one at that — Available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch its forgotten fighter <em>Angel Eyes!</em></p>
<p>Released to Japanese arcades in 1996, <em>Angel Eyes</em> — or to give it its full title<em> Tōkidenshō Angel Eyes</em> — is a super cult 2D fighter that was renowned for sporting an All Anime Gal cast of scrappers. A selection of fun character tropes, including a school girl, a volleyball player, a kunoichi, an arrogant “ojou” woman, and a young girl with a giant teddy bear (<a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dnf-duel-enchantress-trailer-nexon-fighting-games-arcsys/"" target=""_blank"">predating Enchantress by several decades</a>), fight it out in cute ‘n’ colorful action, set against the backdrop of some equally strange locations, such as a fun fair, and a medieval castle!</p>
<p>Check out the cute ‘n’ crazy carnage in the video below, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR2L0bPxY_M"" target=""_blank"">courtesy of YouTuber Colmarr.</a></p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/hR2L0bPxY_M?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Angel Eyes</em>, despite its seeming irrelevance, had some surprisingly prescient ideas. Not only is it one of the first-ever “all women” fighting games, but it is also one of the first 2D fighters to feature a heavy slant on juggles and air combos. Perhaps its funniest and most bizarre mechanic, however, is reserved for the so-called “reverse combo correction” system, which actually<em> increases</em> damage the longer a combo goes on — rather than scales it back. And thus, players with one or two fairly solid combos can find themselves taking down their opponents in a manner of seconds.</p>
<p>You thought <em>Street Fighter V</em> was “three mistakes to death”? Try “one mistake to death”!</p>
<p>Despite its simplistic nature and dopey mechanics, Angel Eyes is, understandably, not without its charm. Though it would receive a JPN PlayStation point in 1997, the series would quietly disappear into the annals of fighting game history. Still, it’s lovely to see it again. And, as opposed to a lot of the Arcade Archives releases, <em>Angel Eyes</em> is a title that actually requires archiving, due to its obscure, rare nature.</p>
<p><em>Angel Eyes</em> is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.</p>

<h2>Team hopes to set precedent for the industry</h2>
<p>Independent outfit <a href=""https://vodeo.games/bb"" target=""_blank"">Vodeo Games</a> is now officially recognized as the first unionized video game studio in North America. The certified motion, achieved in association with the Communication Workers of America, recognizes each and every U.S. and Canadian employee who partakes in full-time, part-time, remote, or contracted work with the company.</p>
<p>“All workers deserve a union and a say in how their workplace is run, no matter where they work, what their employment status is, or what kind of conditions they work under,” said Vodeo Games producer Myriame Lachapelle. “We have been inspired by the growing worker organizing within the gaming industry and hope we can set a new precedent for industry-wide standards that will better our shared working conditions and inspire others to do the same.”</p>

<p>“We were really inspired by what a lot of our colleagues were doing in the game industry and the tech industry and beyond… Voltage Organized Workers, United Paizo Worker… there was a lot going on,” said Vodeo employee and union member Carolyn Jong speaking with Polygon. “It felt like a natural next step for us to be talking about, ‘Hey, maybe we should be unionizing,’ and help set a positive precedent for the digital games industry as well.”</p>
<p>“We’re here to say, ‘Hey, it can be done,'” continues Lachapelle. “It’s often said that the digital game industry is special — that unions are good for other industries, like film, that it wouldn’t work for games, especially smaller indie teams.

<p>Lachapelle is right, of course. And while Vodeo Games might have found it a little easier than most to form the union — due to its small team and open and accepting management — it’s vitally important that all studios and publishers within the industry take steps to both protect and respect the healthcare, rights, and integrity of their respective employees, implementing real, documented, and legally-binding change to ensure that we no longer have to hear horrifying testimony of crunch, workplace abuse, discrimination, and unfair pay grades.</p>

<h2>Take a shot of some Dragon Spirit</h2>
<p>We’re taking another trip back to the late ’80s for this week’s Arcade Archives release, as Hamster reaches into its seemingly bottomless sack of shmups and resurfaces with the Namco and Atari jaunt <em>Dragon Spirit</em>, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

Take a shot of some Dragon Spirit
We’re taking another trip back to the late ’80s for this week’s Arcade Archives release, as Hamster reaches into its seemingly bottomless sack of shmups and resurfaces with the Namco and Atari jaunt Dragon Spirit, now available to download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.
Originally released in arcades in 1987, before later being port to a variety of home computers, Dragon Spirit is a fantasy-themed, vertically scrolling shmup set against the backdrop of a mystical kingdom, Players control a fire-spewing sky beast, Amul, on a dangerous quest to rescue the beautiful Princess Alicia from the nefarious, serpentine Zawell.

As Amul blasts through nine stages and an array of boss characters, they can also upgrade their firepower for both air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements.

<h2>Tag… Team… Back Again</h2>
<p>We are well into the first week of the summer gaming news extravaganza, and in a few short minutes one of the industry’s most dominant giants is getting set to take the digital stage and showcase its upcoming games and projects for the coming months, and perhaps even years: Microsoft Xbox and its pretty pricey subsidiary, Bethesda Games Studios, are about to hold their annual summer live stream.</p>
<p>Neither Xbox nor Bethesda has shared with the public the games that will be featured <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOYnwhKwlw8"" target=""_blank"">in today’s showcase</a>, but we can very likely expect news, updates and reveals on new and previously announced titles such as Ninja Theory’s <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-e3-update/"" target=""_blank""><em>Senua’s Saga: </em><em>Hellblade 2</em></a>, Bethesda’s <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/starfield-delayed-redfall-delay-2023-bethesda-arkane/"" target=""_blank"">delayed<em> Redfall</em> and <em>Starfield</em></a>, and Obsidian’s <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/avowed-is-a-new-fantasy-rpg-coming-from-obsidian-entertainment/"" target=""_blank""><em>Avowed</em></a>, as well as updates on the company’s incredibly successful streaming service, Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>So, be sure to join us here on Destructoid as we all discover what Xbox has in store for its fanbase, and find out how that mighty <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-has-purchased-zenimax-bethesda-for-7-5bn/"" target=""_blank"">$7.5 billion</a> purchase is working out. The Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games live stream kicks off 45 minutes from now, at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST, and is scheduled to run somewhere in the region of 90 minutes.</p>
<p>So pour me one, pour yourself one, and let’s make it a black ‘n’ green Sunday.</p>

		<h2>The strategy RPG is making its way to Nintendo’s portable console</h2>
<p>Tactics fans keep getting more games, and that now includes a surprising port from Aksys Games. <em>Record of Agarest War </em>is making its way to Nintendo Switch in March 2023.</p>
<p>This strategy RPG originally released in 2007 in Japan, eventually making a western debut on the PlayStation 3 in 2009. It’s since been ported to many other platforms and now, years and years later, it pops up again on Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjCvtrHq0kM"" target=""_blank"">here</a>:</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/JjCvtrHq0kM?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>No details have been listed yet about whether this will have any new enhancements or features.</p>
<h2>Generations of war</h2>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with <em>Record of Agarest War</em>, it’s a strategy RPG with a dating twist. Developed as a collaboration between Compile Heart, Red Entertainment, and Idea Factory, you play as several different protagonists embroiled in conflict.</p>
<p>But the way you navigate through the plot is, well, through generations. As the first protagonist, you can romance and marry one of several party members. Then, your child goes on to be protagonist number 2. This plays out across several generations, with the chosen bride affecting the next hero’s stats and aspects of their appearance.</p>

Tag… Team… Back Again
We are well into the first week of the summer gaming news extravaganza, and in a few short minutes one of the industry’s most dominant giants is getting set to take the digital stage and showcase its upcoming games and projects for the coming months, and perhaps even years: Microsoft Xbox and its pretty pricey subsidiary, Bethesda Games Studios, are about to hold their annual summer live stream.
Neither Xbox nor Bethesda has shared with the public the games that will be featured in today’s showcase, but we can very likely expect news, updates and reveals on new and previously announced titles such as Ninja Theory’s Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2, Bethesda’s delayed Redfall and Starfield, and Obsidian’s Avowed, as well as updates on the company’s incredibly successful streaming service, Xbox Game Pass.
So, be sure to join us here on Destructoid as we all discover what Xbox has in store for its fanbase, and find out how that mighty $7.5 billion purchase is working out. The Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games live stream kicks off 45 minutes from now, at 10:00 PT / 13:00 ET / 18:00 BST, and is scheduled to run somewhere in the region of 90 minutes.
So pour me one, pour yourself one, and let’s make it a black ‘n’ green Sunday.

		The strategy RPG is making its way to Nintendo’s portable console
Tactics fans keep getting more games, and that now includes a surprising port from Aksys Games. Record of Agarest War is making its way to Nintendo Switch in March 2023.
This strategy RPG originally released in 2007 in Japan, eventually making a western debut on the PlayStation 3 in 2009. It’s since been ported to many other platforms and now, years and years later, it pops up again on Nintendo Switch.
You can check out the trailer here:

No details have been listed yet about whether this will have any new enhancements or features.
Generations of war
If you’re unfamiliar with Record of Agarest War, it’s a strategy RPG with a dating twist. Developed as a collaboration between Compile Heart, Red Entertainment, and Idea Factory, you play as several different protagonists embroiled in conflict.
But the way you navigate through the plot is, well, through generations. As the first protagonist, you can romance and marry one of several party members. Then, your child goes on to be protagonist number 2. This plays out across several generations, with the chosen bride affecting the next hero’s stats and aspects of their appearance.
So yes, fans of Fire Emblem: Awakening‘s child-unit min-maxing might want to take note. This is a bit of a surprise, as Agarest War has been a more niche series in the pantheon of SRPG discussion. But the genre has been surging, with both new titles and remasters of old classics. It looks like Aksys wasn’t going to let Agarest War sit on the sidelines for this tactical resurgence.
The news arrived as part of an Aksys announcement stream, alongside several other game announcements. Cuddly Forest Friends is set to arrive on Switch in 2023, Spooky Spirit Shooting Gallery heads to Switch in summer 2023, and Tengoku Struggle -Strayside- is set for Switch in 2024.

<h2>Free story expansion coming in summer</h2>
<p><iframe width=""711"" height=""400"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/hErMjWLphng"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Street Fighter IV</em> had a good grip of 2D animated cutscenes providing some closure to individual characters’ Arcade mode arcs, but as a whole the series has been spinning its wheels in that department, especially compared to competitors like <em>Mortal Kombat X</em>. <em>Street Fighter IV</em>, which takes place chronologically after <em>Street Fighter II</em> (1991) failed even to catch up to <em>Street Fighter III</em> (1997) story-wise.</p>
<p>And while a robust and nostalgic cast seemingly revived <em>Street Fighter IV</em> (and all of its re-releases) and carried it across the last console generation, much of that was due to the competitive and professional scene. But more casual fans that like the characters and wild tales have something to look forward to in next month’s <em>Street Fighter V</em>, despite Capcom keeping all story aspects under wraps until now.</p>
<p>I talked with the smiling face of <em>Street Fighter</em>, Yoshinori Ono, last week as the team was ready to break down the story. As some expected, the new game follows <em>Street Fighter IV</em>, but also promises to explain, “how everything flows into <em>Street Fighter III</em>,” incidentally one of the first in the series Ono is credited with. So the existing canon chronology is finally being linked completely.</p>
<p>As for how that works? Every character has a personal Arcade mode story per usual with artwork from famed <em>Street Fighter</em> artist Bengus, the main illustrator on <em>Street Fighter Alpha</em>. You might have noticed during the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/street-fighter-v-beta-gets-story-tutorial-with-alpha-ken-and-ryu-319186.phtml"">beta’s tutorial</a>. This all goes toward what is being considered a “prologue.”</p>
<p><em>Street Fighter V</em>‘s story meat is coming as a free expansion to the game in June of this year with, “a more modern cinematic treatment.” That is to say, as you can see in the trailer, it’s all done in-engine with the same character models you’re street fighting with instead of, say, an animated denouement. There is over an hour’s worth of cinematics in total working toward a cohesive whole rolling into <em>Street Fighter III</em> chronology. And I’m not sweating the format, given the individual character bits are about commensurate with as much story as the games have presented prior. Now all that’s left is next month’s release.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

<h2>And now I’ve hit the point of no return</h2>
<p>I was genuinely on the fence about getting <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga/"" target=""_blank""><em>LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em></a>, but I took a chance that my burnt-out <em>Star Wars</em> fandom wouldn’t botch what seemed to be the culmination of TT Games’ tried-and-true LEGO collectathon formula. Now, I’m one of three million people zipping around the galaxy in search of near-endless Kyber Bricks.</p>
<p>To my fellow collectible obsessors — to folks like me who love <em>Donkey Kong 64</em>, hold the caveats — this game is pretty sweet. It’s the kind of experience you can breezily chip away at for months on end, and it’s a near-nightly co-op pastime for me at this point.</p>
<p>To put it in perspective, <a href=""https://www.powerpyx.com/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-trophy-guide-roadmap/"" target=""_blank"">Powerpyx</a>‘s Trophy Roadmap breakdown marks <em>LEGO Skywalker Saga</em> as a 2/10 on the difficulty scale with a 70- to 90-hour Platinum trophy estimate.</p>
<p>I expected a pleasant enough slow-burn experience as a fan of prior <em>LEGO</em> games like <em>Jurassic World</em>, <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, and <em>Marvel Super Heroes</em> (the GOAT), but I was blown away by the sheer scale of this nine-film juggernaut. The whole game could’ve just been the Free Play hub worlds, and I would’ve been fine with that; in fact, I might’ve preferred it.</p>
<figure><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/LEGO-Star-Wars-The-Skywalker-Saga-Shaak-Ti-screenshot.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""Shaak Ti in LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga"" /><figcaption><sub>Surrounded by collectible markers in a fresh Galaxy Free Play planet.</sub></figcaption></figure>
<h2>A rocky start on Naboo</h2>
<p>You can begin the story on Episode I, Episode IV, or Episode VII. But choose carefully.</p>
<p>Running back and forth to NPCs in Episode I without any excitement between beats felt like a bad omen, but the worst segments of <em>LEGO Skywalker Saga</em> won’t last too long. On the flip side, the best bits — scenes that clicked with my <a href=""https://www.escapistmagazine.com/the-best-and-worst-star-wars-video-games-slightly-something-else/"" target=""_blank""><em>Star Wars</em></a> nostalgia — also felt super brief. It’s fascinating to see what did, and didn’t, make the cut. ~So much~ didn’t.</p>
<p>When everything was said and done, I ended up skimming <a href=""https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Sidious"" target=""_blank"">certain thick-as-hell wiki entries</a>, which I had zero expectation of doing going into this game. As someone who hasn’t <em>really</em> thought about <em>Star Wars</em> since seeing Episode IX in a theater, there’s mental whiplash. LEGO has been a palatable way for me to reopen some wounds and heal others.</p>
<p>All told, the campaign was a nice main-series refresher, though I’m not looking forward to re-running some of these levels for optional hidden trinkets. Unfortunately, I’m at the point of no return. I’ve accumulated enough Stuff that I won’t be able to leave my save file hanging until everything — <em>everything</em> — is scratched off the game’s monstrous checklist.</p>
<figure><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/LEGO-Star-Wars-The-Skywalker-Saga-Lightspeed-screenshot.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""Lightspeed travel in LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga"" /><figcaption><sub>If you’re aiming to do everything, expect to see this transition A LOT. I always fly toward the center to entertain myself. </sub></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Co-op is the way to go if you can swing it</h2>
<p>It took quite a bit of convincing to get my fiancée — who isn’t into <em>Star Wars</em> and doesn’t care for <em>LEGO</em> games — to join me. But she did, so long as I stayed one session ahead.</p>
<p>Our joint Episode I excursion did enough damage that I then had to complete the entire rest of the story on my own so that we’d have access to new, not-yet-100%’d worlds in the Galaxy Free Play mode — she refused to tag along for any other story missions. Randomly exploring open-ended landscapes to find and solve light puzzles, though? We’re both hooked. We go through a couple of planets a night now. It’s nice!</p>
<p><em>LEGO Skywalker Saga</em> is easy and only seems to get easier as you go. There’s an obscene amount of content with an understandably high amount of repetition. There are only really so many puzzle solutions for the collectible Kyber Bricks with only so many uniquely capable characters to leverage, though I don’t necessarily hold that against it.</p>
<p>I’m loving the ability to mostly shut off my brain and still make steady progress night after night. Alone, the core gameplay experience can approach diminishing-returns dullness; in co-op, our divide-and-conquer approach works wonders. It’s more interesting to split up and earn collectibles as fast as possible. The urgency of co-op adds another layer.</p>
<p>Quick aside: If there was a Most Valuable Minifig statistic, Jango Fett would be off the charts for me — his jetpack and upgraded blasters make such short work of so many platforming puzzles and combat challenges. I almost feel guilty skipping 99.9% of the playable cast, but I’ve got my core crew solidified. Shaak Ti is also locked in.</p>
<figure><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/LEGO-Star-Wars-The-Skywalker-Saga-Galaxy-Free-Play-map-screenshot.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""The Galaxy Map in LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga"" /><figcaption><sub>We’re only (only!) at 67% completion and I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.</sub></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Free Play is where it’s at for collectible hunters</h2>
<p>Galaxy Free Play — just running around and grabbing shiny pickups — is my preferred way to experience the game. And that’s really it. That’s the point of this article.</p>
<p>If you’re a collectible-minded player who hasn’t had the best track record with <em>LEGO</em> games in the past but thinks this one might be different for you (or the timing might now be better), I hope some of these thoughts give you the nudge you need. That said, it’s natural to want more from <em>LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em>. I do have hangups.</p>
<p>The more hours I burn away by grabbing “just a few more bricks,” the more I see technical cracks in the foundation with small-but-irritating bugs and even random crashes; the more I realize just how thinly stretched some of these story levels are; the more I wish I could skip takeoff and landing sequences on drawn-out, multi-planet fetch quests.</p>
<p>With respect to the bugs, I am afraid about certain goals, like finding the <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/LegoStarWarsVideoGame/comments/u0mxbl/wandering_wookiee_glitched/"" target=""_blank"">Wandering Wookie</a> on every planet, somehow wigging out before I wrap them up.

And now I’ve hit the point of no return
I was genuinely on the fence about getting LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, but I took a chance that my burnt-out Star Wars fandom wouldn’t botch what seemed to be the culmination of TT Games’ tried-and-true LEGO collectathon formula. Now, I’m one of three million people zipping around the galaxy in search of near-endless Kyber Bricks.
To my fellow collectible obsessors — to folks like me who love Donkey Kong 64, hold the caveats — this game is pretty sweet. It’s the kind of experience you can breezily chip away at for months on end, and it’s a near-nightly co-op pastime for me at this point.
To put it in perspective, Powerpyx‘s Trophy Roadmap breakdown marks LEGO Skywalker Saga as a 2/10 on the difficulty scale with a 70- to 90-hour Platinum trophy estimate.
I expected a pleasant enough slow-burn experience as a fan of prior LEGO games like Jurassic World, Lord of the Rings, and Marvel Super Heroes (the GOAT), but I was blown away by the sheer scale of this nine-film juggernaut. The whole game could’ve just been the Free Play hub worlds, and I would’ve been fine with that; in fact, I might’ve preferred it.
Surrounded by collectible markers in a fresh Galaxy Free Play planet.
A rocky start on Naboo
You can begin the story on Episode I, Episode IV, or Episode VII. But choose carefully.
Running back and forth to NPCs in Episode I without any excitement between beats felt like a bad omen, but the worst segments of LEGO Skywalker Saga won’t last too long. On the flip side, the best bits — scenes that clicked with my Star Wars nostalgia — also felt super brief. It’s fascinating to see what did, and didn’t, make the cut. ~So much~ didn’t.
When everything was said and done, I ended up skimming certain thick-as-hell wiki entries, which I had zero expectation of doing going into this game. As someone who hasn’t really thought about Star Wars since seeing Episode IX in a theater, there’s mental whiplash. LEGO has been a palatable way for me to reopen some wounds and heal others.
All told, the campaign was a nice main-series refresher, though I’m not looking forward to re-running some of these levels for optional hidden trinkets. Unfortunately, I’m at the point of no return. I’ve accumulated enough Stuff that I won’t be able to leave my save file hanging until everything — everything — is scratched off the game’s monstrous checklist.
If you’re aiming to do everything, expect to see this transition A LOT. I always fly toward the center to entertain myself. 
Co-op is the way to go if you can swing it
It took quite a bit of convincing to get my fiancée — who isn’t into Star Wars and doesn’t care for LEGO games — to join me. But she did, so long as I stayed one session ahead.
Our joint Episode I excursion did enough damage that I then had to complete the entire rest of the story on my own so that we’d have access to new, not-yet-100%’d worlds in the Galaxy Free Play mode — she refused to tag along for any other story missions. Randomly exploring open-ended landscapes to find and solve light puzzles, though? We’re both hooked. We go through a couple of planets a night now. It’s nice!
LEGO Skywalker Saga is easy and only seems to get easier as you go. There’s an obscene amount of content with an understandably high amount of repetition. There are only really so many puzzle solutions for the collectible Kyber Bricks with only so many uniquely capable characters to leverage, though I don’t necessarily hold that against it.
I’m loving the ability to mostly shut off my brain and still make steady progress night after night. Alone, the core gameplay experience can approach diminishing-returns dullness; in co-op, our divide-and-conquer approach works wonders. It’s more interesting to split up and earn collectibles as fast as possible. The urgency of co-op adds another layer.
Quick aside: If there was a Most Valuable Minifig statistic, Jango Fett would be off the charts for me — his jetpack and upgraded blasters make such short work of so many platforming puzzles and combat challenges. I almost feel guilty skipping 99.9% of the playable cast, but I’ve got my core crew solidified. Shaak Ti is also locked in.
We’re only (only!) at 67% completion and I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel.
Free Play is where it’s at for collectible hunters
Galaxy Free Play — just running around and grabbing shiny pickups — is my preferred way to experience the game. And that’s really it. That’s the point of this article.
If you’re a collectible-minded player who hasn’t had the best track record with LEGO games in the past but thinks this one might be different for you (or the timing might now be better), I hope some of these thoughts give you the nudge you need. That said, it’s natural to want more from LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. I do have hangups.
The more hours I burn away by grabbing “just a few more bricks,” the more I see technical cracks in the foundation with small-but-irritating bugs and even random crashes; the more I realize just how thinly stretched some of these story levels are; the more I wish I could skip takeoff and landing sequences on drawn-out, multi-planet fetch quests.
With respect to the bugs, I am afraid about certain goals, like finding the Wandering Wookie on every planet, somehow wigging out before I wrap them up. I’m trying not to dwell on that fear, though. If it happens, it happens, and I hope the patches are frequent.
Speaking of, for other co-op players’ sake, I hope the developers add horizontal split-screen. It’s vertical only right now, which I’m used to, but you very well might not be.
There’s no such thing as too many studs.
Let the post-Elden Ring recovery begin
While it’s easy to pick apart so much of LEGO Skywalker Saga critically speaking, weirdly enough, this has ended up becoming the exact right kind of collectathon game I needed to throw myself at after Elden Ring. It’s perfectly low-stakes. Comfy, even. There’s a lot to like about it, even as an infrequent LEGO player who’s (otherwise) tuning out Star Wars at large.
If nothing else, take this advice: before you’re in too deep, consider listening to a podcast or music or literally any other audio source every now and then as a shakeup. Otherwise, LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga will fill your head with unshakable earworms. I hear John Williams fanfare when I go to bed, and the music is still playing when I wake up.

<h2>The Scales of War</h2>
<p>We’re looking to the skies once again, retro gaming fans, as Hamster has released another sky-blasting shmup to its ever-expanding Arcade Archives range. It’s Namco sequel<em> Dragon Saber</em>, now available to download on <a href=""https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0571-CUSA33951_00-HAMPRDC000000001"" target=""_blank"">PS4</a> and <a href=""https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/arcade-archives-dragon-saber-switch/"" target=""_blank"">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
<p>Released into arcades in 1990,<em> Dragon Saber</em> is the follow-up to 1987’s <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/namco-shmup-dragon-spirit-joins-the-arcade-archives/"" target=""_blank"">fantasy-themed blaster<em> Dragon Spirit</em></a>, and once again sees dragon-riding heroes take to the skies to battle armies of strange, invading creatures. As Huey and Siria, one or two players can jump into all-new simultaneous co-op action, which should give you a bit of balance against the hundreds of enemies and end-of-level guardians. In addition, <em>Dragon Saber</em> features a selection of new power-ups, along with a continuation of the game’s lore, which was something of a novelty in the shmup genre at the time.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, <em>Dragon Saber</em> did not receive a wide range of ports, only coming home in the form of a lone PC Engine edition. Aside from appearances on Namco’s previous compilations, this Arcade Archives release represents the first global release of the sequel in some years.<em> Dragon Saber</em> is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

<h2>Back 2 (old) Skool</h2>
<p>Back in 2019, the global gaming community was introduced to two totes-adorbs, totes-dopey schoolyard sluggers: Kyoko and Misako, collectively known as the <em>River City Girls</em>. Essentially a rebirth of sorts for the legendary<em> Kunio-kun</em> series, WayForward’s<em> River City Girls</em> revitalized the franchise for modern audiences, retaining the open-world nature and nose-busting brawling of its predecessors and dressing it up with dazzling colors, a badass soundtrack, slick artwork, and cool new characters. <em>River City Girls</em> reinvented not only the <em>Kunio-kun</em> series, but also brawlers themselves.</p>
<p>However, in news that still surprises folk today, <em>River City Girls</em> was <em>not</em> the debut adventure for Kyoko and Misako. No, our excitable and somewhat obsessive teens made their original video game debut way back in 1994, in Japan-only Super Famicom release <em>Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka</em>, which saw series leads Kunio and Riki team up with their respective gals to get to the bottom of a case of mistaken identity. One broken jaw at a time.</p>
<p>While many of the<em> Kunio-kun</em> titles are playable today via the<em> Double Dragon &amp; Kunio-kun: Retro Brawler Bundle</em>, <em>Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka</em> remained unavailable to western players. Until now, as Arc System Works and WayForward has finally localized this lost sequel for these shores. So fire up the Switch, it’s time to rumble with <em>River City Girls Zero.</em></p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/River-City-Girls-Zero-review-wayforward-2.jpg?resize=640%2C407"" alt=""river city girls zero review nightclub"" /></p>
<p>Our story begins with a hit-and-run tragedy, as a bystander is hit by two dudes on a speeding motorcycle, with one of the riders identified as <em>Kunio-kun</em>‘s titular hero and badass school boss, Kunio. Quick as a flash, our boys find themselves sped through the courts and thrown in the slammer, accused of a crime that they did not commit. This being the video game world, they quickly escape solitary via amusingly easy means, before setting out on a cross-country jaunt to uncover the truth behind the hit -n- run — a jaunt that will see a lot of fists and feet thrown before justice is ultimately served.</p>
<p>It should be noted, first and foremost, that <em>River City Girls Zero</em> is quite unlike a lot of the other titles in the<em> Kunio-kun</em> series. The 16-bit adventure eschews much of the open-city adventure and backtracking of its contemporaries, switching it up for sequential, linear stages as our gang of heroes follows the trail of breadcrumbs to the villains of the piece. For the most part, this consists of very straightforward 2D belt-scrolling action, as Kunio, Riki, Kyoko, and Misako throw down with the bullies, street thugs, gangsters, and other Bad Dudes that have the lowdown on the boys’ mistaken confinement.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/FpJ-UYq9T1k?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p><em>River City Girls Zero</em> is a simplistic brawler. Immensely so. It features the typical punch/kick action that typifies the series’ combat, complete with the classic back-attack, the satisfying ground-and-pound system, and ugly, unwieldy jump kicks. Each character can also put up their dukes to defend against incoming attacks, and all four fighters have their own cool special moves, activated by hitting block and then the requisite attack button. Misako gets her <em>Street Fighter</em> hurricane kick on, while Kyoko opts for seriously overpowered lightning legs.</p>
<p>For the most part, however, <em>River City Girls Zero</em> is a slugfest, exchanging finesse and skill for exploitation, tolerance, and patience.</p>
<p>Whereas the best brawlers, then and especially now, understand the flow of the fight, and the importance of smooth, rhythmic combat,<em> River City Girls Zero</em> is somewhat raw, with stiff movement and ultra-strict hitboxes. The “overlap dead zone” is in effect, and quite often victory is to be achieved through “working” the opponent (for example overlapping from above, walking the opponent into corners, or otherwise tricking the A.I.), rather than through smart combat, an admittedly clunky strategy style demonstrated in Technos’ arcade brawlers such as <em>Double Dragon</em> and <em>The Combattribes.</em></p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/River-City-Girls-Zero-review-wayforward-5.jpg?resize=640%2C422"" alt=""river city girls zero review fair"" /></p>
<p>This stiffness is a problem with many early brawlers, but by 1994, the genre had already moved beyond what is offered in <em>Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka</em>, which, from a gameplay standpoint, feels years older than contemporaries such as Capcom’s <em>Cadillacs and Dinosaurs</em>, or Sega’s <em>Streets of Rage 2</em>, both of which had released over two years prior.</p>
<p>The cute Super Famicom sprites offer much personality to our heroes and villains, and the combat is meaty and relentless, but the game’s design barely advanced from the earliest<em> Kunio-kun</em> titles, when other series had already begun experimenting with much deeper combat mechanics.  As a result, standard enemy encounters are incredibly samey, while boss battles an exercise in “trickery”. The new engine utilized for <em>River City Girls Zero</em> does work to improve the notorious input latency of the original Super Famicom release, making the action here a little more forgiving and responsive to the player.</p>
<p>In the title’s favor, its nicely animated and colorful sprites, variety of citywide locations, and legitimately smooth SNES synth punctuate the action. The anarchic story is also a lot of fun, (you gotta love the police telling our gang of renegade high school kids that it’s fine to take the law into their own hands). Aesthetically and narratively, <em>River City Girls Zero</em> lives its cool and compelling “outlaw” vibe, reminiscent of Toei’s excellent array of ’70s gangster flicks.</p>
<p>As the story progresses and our heroes travel around the country, the side-scrolling stages are linked with <em>Road Rash</em> style motorcycle sections, where the player guns the hog to the next location, while indulging in footsies with enemy riders. These sections are pretty disappointing, dated even by ’94 standards. The overall problem with <em>Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka</em>/<em>River City Girls Zero</em> is that the title lacks a sense of “electricity”, despite its fun story and great soundtrack. Still, as is the case for so many brawlers, the enjoyment is increased with the addition of a second player.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/River-City-Girls-Zero-review-wayforward-3.jpg?resize=640%2C431"" alt /></p>
<p><em>Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka</em> is, without doubt, a piece of gaming history. WayForward recognizes this, and has dressed up the title in a wonderful presentation package. We open with a <em>fantastic</em> anime sequence, (when’s the OVA!!?) backed by an absolute fire song from series composer <a href=""https://twitter.com/MeganMcDuffee"" target=""_blank"">Megan McDuffee</a>. We also get a delightfully meta manga sequence, as Kyoko and Misako pick up a copy of <em>Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka</em> for the Super Famicom and attempt to get it running on, (what must be to them), ancient hardware. Kids these days.</p>
<p>We roll credits with another awesome new tune, and scans of the original artwork and instructional manual are also available to peruse as a fun extra. In regards to localization, there are two English translations on offer: A “Literal” translation, which closely follows the original Japanese text, and a “New” translation which is a little tidier and omits the swearing and misogynistic language of the original script. A useful save state function also helps out in some aggravating boss battles. Ironically, <em>River City Girls Zero</em> fits the bill as a preserved historical relic better than it does as a retro experience.</p>

<p>As both a<em> Kunio-kun</em> and a brawler aficionado, I think it’s marvelous that <em>Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka</em> has been given this new lease of life. It’s gaming history that needed to be archived, both for the legacy of <em>Kunio-kun</em> and for protagonists Kyoko and Misako, a duo <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/river-city-girls-2-new-trailer-nintendo-indie-world-wayforward/"" target=""_blank"">who only have further fantastic adventures ahead</a>. Fans of the series, who can better tolerate its gameplay shortcomings, will squeal with delight that this long-standing hole in their collection has<em> finally</em> been plugged — though even they wouldn’t deny that this entry is, ultimately, one of the series’ weaker offerings.</p>

Back 2 (old) Skool
Back in 2019, the global gaming community was introduced to two totes-adorbs, totes-dopey schoolyard sluggers: Kyoko and Misako, collectively known as the River City Girls. Essentially a rebirth of sorts for the legendary Kunio-kun series, WayForward’s River City Girls revitalized the franchise for modern audiences, retaining the open-world nature and nose-busting brawling of its predecessors and dressing it up with dazzling colors, a badass soundtrack, slick artwork, and cool new characters. River City Girls reinvented not only the Kunio-kun series, but also brawlers themselves.
However, in news that still surprises folk today, River City Girls was not the debut adventure for Kyoko and Misako. No, our excitable and somewhat obsessive teens made their original video game debut way back in 1994, in Japan-only Super Famicom release Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka, which saw series leads Kunio and Riki team up with their respective gals to get to the bottom of a case of mistaken identity. One broken jaw at a time.
While many of the Kunio-kun titles are playable today via the Double Dragon &amp; Kunio-kun: Retro Brawler Bundle, Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka remained unavailable to western players. Until now, as Arc System Works and WayForward has finally localized this lost sequel for these shores. So fire up the Switch, it’s time to rumble with River City Girls Zero.

Our story begins with a hit-and-run tragedy, as a bystander is hit by two dudes on a speeding motorcycle, with one of the riders identified as Kunio-kun‘s titular hero and badass school boss, Kunio. Quick as a flash, our boys find themselves sped through the courts and thrown in the slammer, accused of a crime that they did not commit. This being the video game world, they quickly escape solitary via amusingly easy means, before setting out on a cross-country jaunt to uncover the truth behind the hit -n- run — a jaunt that will see a lot of fists and feet thrown before justice is ultimately served.
It should be noted, first and foremost, that River City Girls Zero is quite unlike a lot of the other titles in the Kunio-kun series. The 16-bit adventure eschews much of the open-city adventure and backtracking of its contemporaries, switching it up for sequential, linear stages as our gang of heroes follows the trail of breadcrumbs to the villains of the piece. For the most part, this consists of very straightforward 2D belt-scrolling action, as Kunio, Riki, Kyoko, and Misako throw down with the bullies, street thugs, gangsters, and other Bad Dudes that have the lowdown on the boys’ mistaken confinement.

River City Girls Zero is a simplistic brawler. Immensely so. It features the typical punch/kick action that typifies the series’ combat, complete with the classic back-attack, the satisfying ground-and-pound system, and ugly, unwieldy jump kicks. Each character can also put up their dukes to defend against incoming attacks, and all four fighters have their own cool special moves, activated by hitting block and then the requisite attack button. Misako gets her Street Fighter hurricane kick on, while Kyoko opts for seriously overpowered lightning legs.
For the most part, however, River City Girls Zero is a slugfest, exchanging finesse and skill for exploitation, tolerance, and patience.
Whereas the best brawlers, then and especially now, understand the flow of the fight, and the importance of smooth, rhythmic combat, River City Girls Zero is somewhat raw, with stiff movement and ultra-strict hitboxes. The “overlap dead zone” is in effect, and quite often victory is to be achieved through “working” the opponent (for example overlapping from above, walking the opponent into corners, or otherwise tricking the A.I.), rather than through smart combat, an admittedly clunky strategy style demonstrated in Technos’ arcade brawlers such as Double Dragon and The Combattribes.

This stiffness is a problem with many early brawlers, but by 1994, the genre had already moved beyond what is offered in Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka, which, from a gameplay standpoint, feels years older than contemporaries such as Capcom’s Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, or Sega’s Streets of Rage 2, both of which had released over two years prior.
The cute Super Famicom sprites offer much personality to our heroes and villains, and the combat is meaty and relentless, but the game’s design barely advanced from the earliest Kunio-kun titles, when other series had already begun experimenting with much deeper combat mechanics.  As a result, standard enemy encounters are incredibly samey, while boss battles an exercise in “trickery”. The new engine utilized for River City Girls Zero does work to improve the notorious input latency of the original Super Famicom release, making the action here a little more forgiving and responsive to the player.
In the title’s favor, its nicely animated and colorful sprites, variety of citywide locations, and legitimately smooth SNES synth punctuate the action. The anarchic story is also a lot of fun, (you gotta love the police telling our gang of renegade high school kids that it’s fine to take the law into their own hands). Aesthetically and narratively, River City Girls Zero lives its cool and compelling “outlaw” vibe, reminiscent of Toei’s excellent array of ’70s gangster flicks.
As the story progresses and our heroes travel around the country, the side-scrolling stages are linked with Road Rash style motorcycle sections, where the player guns the hog to the next location, while indulging in footsies with enemy riders. These sections are pretty disappointing, dated even by ’94 standards. The overall problem with Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka/River City Girls Zero is that the title lacks a sense of “electricity”, despite its fun story and great soundtrack. Still, as is the case for so many brawlers, the enjoyment is increased with the addition of a second player.

Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka is, without doubt, a piece of gaming history. WayForward recognizes this, and has dressed up the title in a wonderful presentation package. We open with a fantastic anime sequence, (when’s the OVA!!?) backed by an absolute fire song from series composer Megan McDuffee. We also get a delightfully meta manga sequence, as Kyoko and Misako pick up a copy of Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka for the Super Famicom and attempt to get it running on, (what must be to them), ancient hardware. Kids these days.
We roll credits with another awesome new tune, and scans of the original artwork and instructional manual are also available to peruse as a fun extra. In regards to localization, there are two English translations on offer: A “Literal” translation, which closely follows the original Japanese text, and a “New” translation which is a little tidier and omits the swearing and misogynistic language of the original script. A useful save state function also helps out in some aggravating boss battles. Ironically, River City Girls Zero fits the bill as a preserved historical relic better than it does as a retro experience.

As both a Kunio-kun and a brawler aficionado, I think it’s marvelous that Shin Nekketsu Koha: Kunio-tachi no Banka has been given this new lease of life. It’s gaming history that needed to be archived, both for the legacy of Kunio-kun and for protagonists Kyoko and Misako, a duo who only have further fantastic adventures ahead. Fans of the series, who can better tolerate its gameplay shortcomings, will squeal with delight that this long-standing hole in their collection has finally been plugged — though even they wouldn’t deny that this entry is, ultimately, one of the series’ weaker offerings.
River City Girls Zero is available now on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, PC, and Xbox. River City Girls 2 is currently in development for PlayStation, PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

<h2>Truffle Shuffle Super</h2>
<p>Those naughty MultiVersus dataminers are at it again, delving into the code of Player First Games’ madcap platform fighter and pulling out clues pertaining to upcoming characters and stages — In fact, just this weekend, one such digger <a href=""https://twitter.com/multiversusie/status/1584180607177101317?s=20&amp;t=CI339P3hx-XJ070QVSuVqg"" target=""_blank"">ventured into the new update</a> and surfaced with a reference to the iconic 1985 classic, <em>The Goonies.</em></p>
<p>Directed by Richard Donner and written by Steven Spielberg, <em>The Goonies</em> tells the tale of a group of misfit children, who embark upon a wild adventure of danger and intrigue while exploring the legend of notorious pirate One-Eyed Willie. <em>The Goonies</em> has transcended generations due to its dopey slapstick comedy, <em>Indiana Jones</em>-esque action, and litany of quotable lines and memorable characters. Today, decades after its release, it remains something of a rite of passage for young film fans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>on the Multiversus Hub server, one of the dataminers there has found a string of Goonies mentioned as a Character Universe, there MIGHT be a chance that Sloth or any of the Goonies characters could come to Multiversus soon but for now, i'd say take it as a grain of salt- <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://t.co/Qq9ri6MObn"">pic.twitter.com/Qq9ri6MObn</a></p>
<p>— Susie – Multiversus Leaks (@multiversusie) <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/multiversusie/status/1584180607177101317?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">October 23, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The data pulled from the new <em>MultiVersus</em> update includes a “Character Universe” code — essentially a folder in which data is stored by IP, (for example “DC Comics” or “Gremlins”), this would suggest the possibility of one or more <em>Goonies</em> characters might be in the works for the star-studded fighter, though we are probably more likely to get Sloth than we are Mama Fratelli. Of course, this code could also be a “just in case” placeholder, with no confirmed plan to bring in The Goonies anytime soon. We shall see.</p>
<p><em>The Goonies</em> is the latest in a number of unannounced IPs and characters to be found lurking within the MultiVersus code. Previous datamines have uncovered dialogue and/or references pertaining to <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-datamine-joker-voice-player-first-games-dc-comics/"" target=""_blank"">DC Comics supervillain Joker</a>, The Ghost with the Most, <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-black-adam-stripe-season-one-beetlejuice-leak/"" target=""_blank"">Beetlejuice</a>, and <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>‘s very own <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-black-adam-stripe-season-one-beetlejuice-leak/"" target=""_blank"">Wicked Witch of the West</a>. To date, none of these characters have been officially confirmed by Player First Games.</p>
<p>MultiVersus is available now in open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.</p>

on the Multiversus Hub server, one of the dataminers there has found a string of Goonies mentioned as a Character Universe, there MIGHT be a chance that Sloth or any of the Goonies characters could come to Multiversus soon but for now, i'd say take it as a grain of salt- pic.twitter.com/Qq9ri6MObn
— Susie – Multiversus Leaks (@multiversusie) October 23, 2022
The data pulled from the new MultiVersus update includes a “Character Universe” code — essentially a folder in which data is stored by IP, (for example “DC Comics” or “Gremlins”), this would suggest the possibility of one or more Goonies characters might be in the works for the star-studded fighter, though we are probably more likely to get Sloth than we are Mama Fratelli. Of course, this code could also be a “just in case” placeholder, with no confirmed plan to bring in The Goonies anytime soon. We shall see.
The Goonies is the latest in a number of unannounced IPs and characters to be found lurking within the MultiVersus code. Previous datamines have uncovered dialogue and/or references pertaining to DC Comics supervillain Joker, The Ghost with the Most, Beetlejuice, and The Wizard of Oz‘s very own Wicked Witch of the West. To date, none of these characters have been officially confirmed by Player First Games.
MultiVersus is available now in open beta on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.

<h2>Oh and two other insane games</h2>
<p>This is super weird, because I have vivid memories of renting two of the three bizarre <a href=""https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/super-nintendo-entertainment-system-nintendo-switch-online-switch/"" target=""_blank"">SNES games that just arrived on the Switch Online service</a> this week. I’ll start with <em>Claymates</em>, which you should probably try, in part because of how dang weird it is.</p>
<p>Platformers were a dime a dozen on the NES and SNES, but have you ever played one with this premise?</p>
<p>“The protagonist of the game is a boy named Clayton, whose scientist father has developed a serum that can transform people into animals when it is combined with clay. Suddenly, Jobo the witch doctor appears and demands the formula for the serum. The father refuses, to which Jobo replies by changing Clayton into a ball of clay and stealing away both his father and the serum.”</p>
<p>I thought not! The SNES was a boon for strange concepts, and <em>Claymates</em> was no exception. Playing as a blue ball of goo as your default form, you’ll roll around and morph into various animals, all of which control a little differently. It even made a snazzy “blast processing” [blaze processing] joke in 1993 when it was fresh.</p>
<p>Next up is <em>Jelly Boy</em>, a European exclusive that’s finally getting a chance overseas, followed by <em>Bombuzal</em> (aka Dynamite Kablooey). The latter has extremely “your parents rented this for you, but oh my God this puzzle game gets insanely hard very quick” vibes and a super weird mascot. Nintendo calls them an “array of quirky and combustible” and they aren’t lying! If you need convincing that these games are worth dabbling in, check out the video from Nintendo below.</p>
<p>I totally get that people are probably pissed off <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/uh-oh-nintendo-warns-that-nes-snes-switch-online-monthly-release-cadence-is-off-the-table/"" target=""_blank"">with the glacial pace that retro games are added to Switch Online</a>, and giving us three bonkers things probably isn’t providing a lot of goodwill.

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

Oh and two other insane games
This is super weird, because I have vivid memories of renting two of the three bizarre SNES games that just arrived on the Switch Online service this week. I’ll start with Claymates, which you should probably try, in part because of how dang weird it is.
Platformers were a dime a dozen on the NES and SNES, but have you ever played one with this premise?
“The protagonist of the game is a boy named Clayton, whose scientist father has developed a serum that can transform people into animals when it is combined with clay. Suddenly, Jobo the witch doctor appears and demands the formula for the serum. The father refuses, to which Jobo replies by changing Clayton into a ball of clay and stealing away both his father and the serum.”

<h2>Generation When?</h2>
<p>Sony has released its financial results for <a href=""https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/22q1_sonypre.pdf"" target=""_blank"">the fiscal year ending June 31, 2022</a> (Q1 2022), and while the PlayStation 5 platform continues to gather slight momentum on a global scale, overall the brand is seeing a general decline in customer expenditure, particularly in the realm of software and subscriptions.</p>
<p>The mighty PS5 has now hit an impressive 21.7 million global shipments since its launch in the fall of 2020, with around 2.4 million consoles shipped in Q1. While this number is certainly nothing to be sniffed at, it reflects an increasingly granular sales growth when compared to that of the company’s previous PlayStation hardware launches. Still, the numbers are moving in the right direction, if <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/ps5-shipments-sales-march-2022-sony-ps4-playstation-target/"" target=""_blank"">a little more slowly</a> than Sony had perhaps hoped.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ps5-shipments-sales-q1-2022-horizon.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""sony ps5 shipments sales q1 2022 results horizon"" /></p>
<p>In the realm of software, accessories, and subscriptions, however, a different tale is being told. PS4 and PS5 games sales totaled 47.1 million units this past quarter, which is down almost 17 million year-on-year. This is particularly notable given that 2022 has seen many of the industry’s biggest hitters all launched atypically earlier this year, so one would actually assume numbers would be <em>up</em> on previous years. 79% of all game sales were digital, an increase of 8% on the previous quarter.</p>
<p>PlayStation is still attempting to claw back lost subscribers to its popular PlayStation Plus service. The last quarter of 2021 saw the service decline in users for the first time in many years, and while the latest quarter did not<em> quite</em> recover, it has seen something of an increase, now standing at around 47.3 million users. Of course, SIE has just launched its <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/playstation-plus-extra-premium-rebrand-xbox-gamepass-ps4-ps5-sony/"" target=""_blank"">revamped PlayStation Plus service</a>, so it will be interesting to see how this affects the user base for the next quarter.</p>
<p>Overall, this is no sign whatsoever that PlayStation is in any sort of danger — we’re still talking a revenue of millions upon millions — but it is a sign that the latest generation of gaming continues in its struggle to find a solid foothold. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, an increased cost of living, scalpers, production woes, component shortages, and general human apathy all play a role in the gaming industry’s continued malaise — one that is affecting developers, publishers, and manufacturers.</p>

<h2>Old school in a new era</h2>
<p>When I first heard that Gungrave was coming back with not one, but two projects, I was in shock. This is a series that felt buried roughly two decades ago after <em>Gungrave: Overdose</em> on the PS2, but nonetheless <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-gungrave-vr/"">we got a so-so VR adaptation</a>, and very soon: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.gungrave.com/?g_country=en""><em>Gungrave GORE</em></a>.</p>
<p>We had a chance to play a preview build, and it feels like a blast from the past (in ways that will both delight and disappoint).</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Gungrave-GORE-1.jpg?resize=640%2C360"" alt=""Gungrave GORE 1"" /></p>
<p>One thing I swiftly noticed after starting up <em>Gungrave GORE</em> is how much it asks you to already be somewhat invested in the lore. The quick intro was partially incomprehensible for newcomers, with a lot of exposition required, and less emotional resonance. What you mostly need to know is that anti-hero Grave is trying to kill the Ravenclan, led by four eccentric bosses who, in a literal sense, are big bads in a video game. Some slightly incorrect subtitles later, all my <em>Gungrave</em> anime-watching and game-playing knowledge came rushing back.</p>
<p>You aren’t going to be alone if you’re coming in blind and are partially confused. In fact, this passage is straight from the developers:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The previous games do not have to be played to experience <em>GORE</em>, although certain established concepts might take some getting used to by newcomers, especially revolving around the Seed. The common thread between the games is the Seed and the relationship between Grave and Mika. In a sense, <em>Gungrave GORE</em> is the finalization of the Seed story arc and the culmination of Grave’s story since the real super villain is finally revealed and defeated.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If you’re just looking for a pure action experience, then you’re probably covered. The intro to the first stage is devilishly over-the-top, with Grave destroying a bunch of goons at the entrance to a facility, before the player takes over and does much of the same. The first thing I noticed, gameplay-wise, was the focus on style: a lost art in many character action games.</p>
<p>There’s a “beat count,” which serves as a combo aggregator of sorts, as well as the classic “diving/dodge shot” move that made the original games famous among action aficionados. You can also melee (with the coffin on your back) which also deflects rockets, grab enemies, initiate execution kills, or trigger ultimates governed by a meter (which usually involve firing something out of your coffin).</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Gungrave-GORE-2.jpg?resize=640%2C360"" alt=""Gungrave GORE 2"" /></p>
<p>There’s <em>a lot</em> of goons to kill. Action vets will want to jack the game’s difficulty up to hard right away, as fighting through some of <em>Gungrave GORE</em>‘s enemy types and layouts feel like going through the motions. You’ll have access to a shield (which recharges and can fend off raw health damage), which is extremely generous to the point where you can walk through a lot of gunfire and came out unscathed.</p>
<p>It’s an intriguing push and pull. The team clearly wants Grave to to feel like an unstoppable force, and has to balance that around actual tension. Hopefully as levels progress the general pool of enemies will offer up new puzzles and challenges for everyone to conquer: as that’s my main concern. The core of jumping/diving around like an anime action hero is intact.</p>
<p>The bosses are the things that, by far, have the most potential to really deliver in <em>GORE</em>. An early one is a giant tank, which requires a fair bit of dodging and focus to take down without sustaining a ton of damage. It’s an early encounter, but it showed a lot of promise in terms of how far <em>GORE</em> could really go, and deliver a modern version of PS2-era chaos. At present, the game is in a really unique position as a niche character action game in 2022.</p>
<p><em>Gungrave GORE</em> is out on November 22, and I’m curious to see how it will be received by general audiences and <em>Gungrave</em> fans alike. The studio says that it will take “14+ hours” to finish the game, and it’ll run you $50 on both PC and consoles.</p>

<h2>Sam Kerr and Marcus Rashford prove key players</h2>
<p>Despite having only launched just one month ago, Electronic Arts’ <em>FIFA 23</em> has already seen more engagement and playtime than some games can only dream of in their entire lifespan — Not only is the soccer sim <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/fifa-23-10-million-biggest-launch-electronic-arts-ea-football/"" target=""_blank"">the fastest-selling entry</a> in franchise history, but the community has already played some 1.7 billion matches over the course of the past four weeks.</p>
<p>EA Sports noted the bewildering figure <a href=""https://twitter.com/EASPORTSFIFA/status/1587127376974151688?s=20&amp;t=r1NmmBMRRLW1qa-Z22GOrA"" target=""_blank"">in a fun stat sheet</a> pertaining to the new title, which launched on PC and consoles on September 29. According to the figures, over 200 nations have played for a total of 15 billion minutes, scoring 4.3 billion goals across the 1.7 billion matches. The top male goal scorer is Manchester United and England National player Marcus Rashford, while the top female scorer is Chelsea Women’s Sam Kerr. Kerr also features on the cover of the Ultimate Edition and is the first woman soccer player to do so.</p>

<h2>The Meta gets a little more expensive</h2>
<p>The price of the Meta Quest 2 is going up next month. Today, the VR company announced the Meta Quest 2 virtual reality headset will get a price bump in August, tacking another $100 onto the price tag.</p>
<p>This will bring the Meta Quest 2 up to $399.99 for the 128 GB version, and the 256 GB version up to $499.99. Refurbished units and Meta Quest 2 accessories will also see a price increase.</p>
<p>Meta, a.k.a. Facebook, bought Oculus in <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/facebook-to-acquire-oculus-vr-for-around-2-billion/"" target=""_blank"">2014</a> and shifted the naming convention away from Oculus and under Meta in <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/boz/posts/10114026973983491"" target=""_blank"">2021</a>. In <a href=""https://www.oculus.com/blog/meta-quest-2-pricing-changes/"" target=""_blank"">today’s statement</a> on the pricing change, the company acknowledges VR’s momentum, but also cites the cost of production as a concern.</p>
<blockquote><p>“At the same time, the costs to make and ship our products have been on the rise. By adjusting the price of Quest 2, we can continue to grow our investment in groundbreaking research and new product development that pushes the VR industry to new heights.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Those who pick up a Meta Quest 2 headset between August 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022 will get a freebie. A copy of <em>Beat Saber </em>will be free to download for 14 days, after they’ve activated the headset.</p>

<h2>The cost of virtual reality</h2>
<p>This is surprising on a few levels. First, the Quest 2 has <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/review-oculus-quest-2/"" target=""_blank"">been available since 2020</a>. A price hike without a hardware refresh is strange, to say the least.</p>
<p>But the Oculus Quest 2, or Meta Quest 2, has been the affordable entry point to virtual reality. Its ability to run wireless or hooked up to a computer is a huge boon. And the price point made it a no-brainer for those looking to get into the technology.</p>
<p>It certainly ratchets up the potential appeal of other headsets. For those who already managed to grab a PlayStation 5, the <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/playstation-ps-vr-2-first-look-headset-design-sony/"" target=""_blank"">PS VR2</a> is slowly but surely leading up to its eventual launch.</p>

When do My Nintendo points expire? Well it depends on the type of point it is! Let’s go over both briefly as we head into the holiday season.

It’s important to game the system as much as possible: meaning, there are ways to bank missions and not actually complete them until you need them. Our guide goes into more detail on this, and how you can use Fire Emblem Heroes to your advantage.
Gold Points, which are more like cash that can be used directly for eShop payments, expire in 12 months. There’s a lot more leeway here with the expanded timeframe, but note that since a lot of folks make purchases in December, you might be coming up on a time period where a bunch will expire.

<h2>The Bat-Family sets a date for their fight against crime</h2>
<p>Co-op action game <em>Gotham Knights </em>has finally set a release date. WB Games Montreal’s brawler will take to the streets of Gotham on Oct. 25, 2022.</p>
<p>The new date was <a href=""https://twitter.com/GothamKnights/status/1501558438681317380"" target=""_blank"">revealed this morning</a>, and shared on social media. Though originally set for a 2021 launch, <em>Gotham Knights </em>was <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/gotham-knights-is-slipping-to-2022/"" target=""_blank"">delayed into 2022 almost a full year ago</a>. The Bat Crew is now finally getting their chance to take on crime this fall, instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gotham will always need its heroes. Suit up for an all-new adventure on 10.25.22. <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/GothamKnights?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#GothamKnights</a> <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://t.co/d7oV2LbcT8"">pic.twitter.com/d7oV2LbcT8</a></p>
<p>— Gotham Knights (@GothamKnights) <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/GothamKnights/status/1501558438681317380?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">March 9, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The set-up of <em>Gotham Knights </em>is that Batman is dead (presumably), and his many protégés must take up the Bat-Mantle and fight the evildoers of Gotham in his stead. It’s an action game that takes after the <em>Batman: Arkham </em>series, but with character-specific moves and abilities in play.</p>
<p>The four playable heroes are Robin, Batgirl, Nightwing, and Red Hood.

<p>Those itching for some more heroic, <em>Arkham</em>-style adventures have been waiting patiently for more news on <em>Gotham Knights</em>.

No doubt that timeframe will start to fill up as we get into the summer of game announcements, but <em>Gotham Knights </em>is getting out ahead of the pack and setting its sights on October 25.</p>

The Bat-Family sets a date for their fight against crime
Co-op action game Gotham Knights has finally set a release date. WB Games Montreal’s brawler will take to the streets of Gotham on Oct. 25, 2022.
The new date was revealed this morning, and shared on social media. Though originally set for a 2021 launch, Gotham Knights was delayed into 2022 almost a full year ago. The Bat Crew is now finally getting their chance to take on crime this fall, instead.

Gotham will always need its heroes. Suit up for an all-new adventure on 10.25.22. #GothamKnights pic.twitter.com/d7oV2LbcT8
— Gotham Knights (@GothamKnights) March 9, 2022
The set-up of Gotham Knights is that Batman is dead (presumably), and his many protégés must take up the Bat-Mantle and fight the evildoers of Gotham in his stead. It’s an action game that takes after the Batman: Arkham series, but with character-specific moves and abilities in play.
The four playable heroes are Robin, Batgirl, Nightwing, and Red Hood. It’s also set to feature several Bat-verse villains—one of the early trailers centered around Mr. Freeze—but puts the Court of Owls at the center of the drama. The secret society is up to no good, and there’s a legion of angry owl-fighters to back them up.

Those itching for some more heroic, Arkham-style adventures have been waiting patiently for more news on Gotham Knights. Now at least, the co-op brawler has set a date and looks to be one of the first big fall releases on the calendar. No doubt that timeframe will start to fill up as we get into the summer of game announcements, but Gotham Knights is getting out ahead of the pack and setting its sights on October 25.

<h2>Holding company goes on a spending spree</h2>
<p>Video game holding company Embracer Group has announced a series of mergers and acquisitions, which sees the Swedish conglomerate open its doors for <em>Borderlands</em> developer <a href=""https://embracer.com/release/embracer-group-merges-with-the-gearbox-entertainment-company-and-form-a-seventh-operating-group/"" target=""_blank"">Gearbox Entertainment</a>, Mac developer/publisher <a href=""https://embracer.com/release/embracer-group-acquires-aspyr-media/"" target=""_blank"">Aspyr Media</a>, and mobile game developer <a href=""https://www.gematsu.com/2021/02/embracer-group-to-merge-with-easybrain"" target=""_blank"">Easybrain</a>.</p>
<p>Of these purchases the spotlight has mostly fallen on the acquisition of long-time independent Gearbox Entertainment, which was purchased for $363 million, with a six-year performance target of $1.3 billion. Naturally, questions have been asked regarding the developer’s team of personnel and future releases, with <em>Borderlands</em> publisher 2K Games being quick to note that the Embracer merger does <em>not</em> affect the relationship between 2K and Gearbox. The former will continue to publish<em> Borderlands</em> sequels going forward. (And given that six-year performance plan, we’ll definitely be seeing them).</p>
<p>As for Gearbox as a studio, founder and magician Randy Pitchford will continue to lead a team of 550 employees on all future projects. Speaking in a <a href=""https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-02-03-pitchford-says-embracer-is-like-a-rocket-booster-for-gearboxs-ambitions"" target=""_blank"">new interview with GamesIndustry.biz,</a> Pitchford called the merger “a rocket booster for our ambitions and our mission to entertain the world,” while noting that “Embracer’s strategy also provides access to capital, and access to capital was a limiting factor in Gearbox’s ambitions.”</p>
<p>Gearbox Entertainment, Aspyr Media, and EasyBrain join Embracer’s already expansive family of developers and publishers, which also includes DECA Games, Coffee Stain Holding, and AAA publisher THQ Nordic, along with its subsidiaries Saber Interactive and Koch Media… Yikes. Lend us a tenner.</p>

<h2>Let Them Eat Swarfega</h2>
<p>For me personally, one of the most intriguing and exciting announcements made during last year’s summer of livestreams was the reveal of<em> <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/steelrising-is-an-action-rpg-about-the-robot-french-revolution-from-the-greedfall-developer-596646.phtml"" target=""_blank"">Steelrising</a></em>, an action-RPG currently in production at <em>Greedfall</em> developer Spiders.</p>
<p>My interest immediately piqued at the project’s concept: a retelling of The French Revolution, but with an army of lavish, creepy, and sentient androids as the main players in this particularly grim moment of human history. For the reveal, we were given a teaser trailer showing off <em>Steelrising</em>‘s concept and steampunky aesthetic, but things have been very quiet since then, though I’ve remained very curious about the project.</p>
<p><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/KDAaeBSp4ow"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>It seems that development has steadily continued, and Spiders is now ready to start playtesting basic builds of the strange release. The studio will be testing internally, but is also opening up <em>Steelrising</em> to members of the public, offering them an early look at what could prove to be one of 2021’s most unique releases. Interested parties can sign up by filling <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8HtDfBX3wXtK9_ppfb3z56gRIxKDOhtMfKYlV8N901CCl9g/viewform"" target=""_blank"">in this short questionnaire</a>, which asks for the participant’s platform of choice, as well as their experience with titles such as <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Bloodborne</em>, and <em>Darksiders</em> – which somewhat suggests the gameplay style Spiders is aiming for with <em>Steelrising</em>.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/review-greedfall-569766.phtml"" target=""_blank""><em>GreedFall</em></a> launched in 2019 to a mostly positive but mixed reception. Critics and players appreciated the world and characters Spiders created in its doomsday exploration adventure, but criticized the title for being rough around the edges and inconsistent with some of its mechanics. Hopefully, with the experience of developing <em>GreedFall</em> and the power of next-gen tech under its belt, Spiders can ensure that <em>Steelrising</em> delivers upon its fascinating premise, perhaps even becoming one of the best sleeper titles of 2021.</p>
<p>Regardless, I’m up to throwdown with Marie Androidette.<em><br /></em></p>

<h2>The studio will have a new early access game next year</h2>
<p>The company currently behind <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> has announced that a new studio will be joining its ranks. Krafton has confirmed it will be acquiring <em>Subnautica </em>and <em>Natural Selection</em> developer Unknown Worlds.</p>
<p>This adds another games studio to Krafton’s lineup, which already includes PUBG Studios, Bluehole Studio, RisingWings, Dreamotion, and Striking Distance Studios. Unknown Worlds will continue to function as an independent studio, with its structure and leadership intact.</p>
<p>“It was immediately apparent how closely Unknown Worlds and Krafton are aligned in the way we think about games and game development,” said Unknown Worlds CEO Charlie Cleveland in a press release. “<em>Subnautica</em> and <em>PUBG</em> both started humbly and evolved successfully through constant iteration and feedback. We want to bring new games to the world stage—and with Krafton, we’re a big step closer. We’re truly looking forward to our future together.”</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/rdix1XxaZyU?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>Unknown Worlds will continue working on updates for <em>Subnautica </em>and <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-subnautica-below-zero/"" target=""_blank""><em>Subnautica: Below Zero</em></a>. Today’s announcement also confirmed the developer is currently working on a new “genre-defining” game, which is set to launch in early access next year.</p>
<p>Krafton has been steadily acquiring new projects over the past few years. One very notable one is <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/the-callisto-protocol-is-gonna-remind-you-of-dead-space-in-all-the-best-ways/"" target=""_blank""><em>The Callisto Protocol</em></a>, which is a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnVhgyLbC8A"" target=""_blank"">sci-fi horror game</a> set in the <em>PUBG </em>universe being developed by Striking Distance Studios by former <em>Dead Space </em>developers.</p>
<p>It also recently rebranded <em>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</em>, often shorthanded into <em>PUBG</em>, to be <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/pubg-rebrands-playerunknowns-battlegrounds-pc-news/"" target=""_blank""><em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em></a>.</p>
<p>There’s no more information on what Unknown Worlds is working on, or whether it will have similar ties to the <em>PUBG </em>brand. That said, <em>Subnautica </em>is one of those games that really seems to inspire a lot of fervor in its fans. Their next project will likely be one to keep an eye on.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

The studio will have a new early access game next year
The company currently behind PUBG: Battlegrounds has announced that a new studio will be joining its ranks. Krafton has confirmed it will be acquiring Subnautica and Natural Selection developer Unknown Worlds.
This adds another games studio to Krafton’s lineup, which already includes PUBG Studios, Bluehole Studio, RisingWings, Dreamotion, and Striking Distance Studios. Unknown Worlds will continue to function as an independent studio, with its structure and leadership intact.
“It was immediately apparent how closely Unknown Worlds and Krafton are aligned in the way we think about games and game development,” said Unknown Worlds CEO Charlie Cleveland in a press release. “Subnautica and PUBG both started humbly and evolved successfully through constant iteration and feedback. We want to bring new games to the world stage—and with Krafton, we’re a big step closer. We’re truly looking forward to our future together.”

Unknown Worlds will continue working on updates for Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero. Today’s announcement also confirmed the developer is currently working on a new “genre-defining” game, which is set to launch in early access next year.
Krafton has been steadily acquiring new projects over the past few years. One very notable one is The Callisto Protocol, which is a sci-fi horror game set in the PUBG universe being developed by Striking Distance Studios by former Dead Space developers.
It also recently rebranded PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, often shorthanded into PUBG, to be PUBG: Battlegrounds.
There’s no more information on what Unknown Worlds is working on, or whether it will have similar ties to the PUBG brand. That said, Subnautica is one of those games that really seems to inspire a lot of fervor in its fans. Their next project will likely be one to keep an eye on.


 


						
	
		Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs
Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.
The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.

In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.
The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.

For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.

<p>Tactics fans keep getting more games, and that now includes a surprising port from Aksys Games. <em>Record of Agarest War </em>is making its way to Nintendo Switch in March 2023.</p>
<p>This strategy RPG originally released in 2007 in Japan, eventually making a western debut on the PlayStation 3 in 2009. It’s since been ported to many other platforms and now, years and years later, it pops up again on Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>If you’re unfamiliar with <em>Record of Agarest War</em>, it’s a strategy RPG with a dating twist. Developed as a collaboration between Compile Heart, Red Entertainment, and Idea Factory, you play as several different protagonists embroiled in conflict.</p>
<p>But the way you navigate through the plot is, well, through generations. As the first protagonist, you can romance and marry one of several party members. Then, your child goes on to be protagonist number 2. This plays out across several generations, with the chosen bride affecting the next hero’s stats and aspects of their appearance.</p>
