<h2>The slimy indie hit returns</h2>
<p>Lots of great indie games have been getting a lot of love this year — <em>Stray</em> was Annapurna’s biggest launch by far, and <em>Cult of the Lamb </em>had <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/cult-of-the-lamb-hits-over-a-million-players-in-only-a-week/"" target=""_blank"">over a million players in a week</a>. Now it looks like <em>Slime Rancher 2</em> is joining those ranks, because it has reached a big milestone of over 100,000 copies within the first six hours of its release. Nick Popovich, co-founder and CEO of the studio behind the <em>Slime Rancher </em>series Monomi Park, shared a tweet yesterday thanking fans for making the game a success.</p>
<p>For those who may not be familiar, the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-slime-rancher/"">first </a><em><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-slime-rancher/"" target=""_blank"">Slime Rancher</a> </em>game came out back in 2017 after about a year of being in early access. In the game, players take on the role of a farmer tasked with collecting and breeding different types of slimes on their very own ranch, all wrapped up in an open-world FPS-style packaging. Critical reception to <em>Slime Rancher</em> was favorable, but over the years it garnered something of a cult following, and got PlayStation and Switch releases years after its initial launch for PC and Xbox.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had a pipe dream in my head that we could sell 100k copies of Slime Rancher 2 in the first 24 hrs if the stars aligned. And we did that in less than 6 hrs. No idea where this crazy train is headed but so grateful to have a chance to ride it.

<p>Anecdotally, I’ve seen love for the <em>Slime Rancher</em> series spread through word of mouth more than anything — it’s another one of those <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/how-stardew-valley-ushered-in-farming-simulators-renaissance/"" target=""_blank"">cozy farming-style games</a> that players just can’t seem to get enough of.

<p>100,000 may seem like a relatively small number compared to some huge launches that can be in the millions, but for an indie studio, that can be life-changing.

		CMA filings show how the Activision Blizzard deal could help build the Xbox mobile store
Amid investigations over Microsoft’s possible acquisition of Activision Blizzard, new details have emerged about its plans for a mobile store to compete with other platforms.
Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal is under investigation by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). As part of those filings, Microsoft says a motivation for the acquisition is to help build out its mobile presence.
Here’s the relevant item from the CMA filing, as reported on by The Verge:
“The transaction will improve Microsoft’s ability to create a next generation game store which operates across a range of devices, including mobile as a result of the addition of Activision Blizzard’s content. Building on Activision Blizzard’s existing communities of gamers, Xbox will seek to scale the Xbox Store to mobile, attracting gamers to a new Xbox Mobile Platform.

A more mobile Xbox
Microsoft has been pushing more and more into the mobile market. Putting its cloud gaming service on phones makes for pretty good reasons to pick up a controller clip and game on the go.
But this new development could see Microsoft opening its own platform, one that would compete with Google’s Play Store and the App Store.
Mobile gaming revenue from Activision Blizzard is strong, as Microsoft notes in the filing. The output of the King side of Activision Blizzard, alongside games like Call of Duty: Mobile, represent a good chunk of revenue.
The acquisition remains under scrutiny though, as the CMA continues to investigate.
In other Activision Blizzard news, Blizzard Albany workers recently won approval for a union vote.

<h2>Ahead of the November 2022 launch, here’s a bit of gameplay from the remake</h2>
<p>Certain video game sound effects never quite leave us, and I can safely say that the “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6FELqeX5UM"" target=""_blank"">smacking a caveman</a>” noise from <em>Joe &amp; Mac 2: Lost in the Tropics</em> is still living in my head rent-free all these years later. It may not be my <em>favorite</em> arcade-ish action-platformer series, but I’ve got a soft spot for it in a surprisingly deep sea of retro caveman games.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/joe-and-mac-caveman-ninja-remake-microids-retro/"" target=""_blank"">As previously announced</a>, <em>Joe &amp; Mac</em> is coming back this year with a remake called <em>New Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja</em> — and here’s a (ridiculously) quick look at it in action.</p>

<p>This Data East revival is being developed by Mr. Nutz Studio and Microids, who also handled the <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-toki/"" target=""_blank""><em>Toki</em></a> remake, and while the spruced-up new art will be a hard sell for some, I’m happy to see this dinosaur-whacking duo back in action; I’ll take what I can get!</p>
<p>After seeing this footage, I’m not any more or less “sold” on the remake’s clean new art than before. It’s something I’ll likely get used to over time. It is an adjustment.</p>
<p>Along with the original arcade experience, <em>New Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja</em> will have a “longer version of the story mode” under an Extended banner. The remake is also bringing back two-player co-op and including a speedrun mode, training, and even a boss rush.</p>
<h2>Microids showed off the physical T-Rex Edition</h2>
<p>The PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch physical copies of <em>New Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja</em> come with two sticker sheets, a retro trading card, and a tyrannosaurus keychain.</p>

<p>The game is also launching on Xbox Series X/S and PC, albeit only as a digital release.</p>
<p>In all cases, <em>New Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja</em> will release in November 2022.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling nostalgic and you’ve got a (basic) Nintendo Switch Online subscription, you can revisit <em>Joe &amp; Mac</em> and <em>Joe &amp; Mac 2</em> in the SNES library. I vastly prefer the sequel, especially after comparing notes with Chris Moyse, but you do you.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

<h2>Set to launch in 2023</h2>
<p>It’s hard to believe that <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-super-bomberman-r/""><em>Super Bomberman R</em></a>, a flawed revival of the series, came out five whole years ago, but here we are. It was a Switch launch game even, and over a year later it made the jump to PC, PS4, and Xbox One.  After all these years <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.konami.com/games/bomberman/r2/us/en/""><em>Super Bomberman R 2</em></a> is now a thing, and it’s going to launch on basically everything and ring in its own set of improvements.</p>
<p>So this time, Konami is eliminating any of the mystique of a timed exclusive platform. Although it technically debuted during the Nintendo Direct Mini presentation this week, Super Bomberman R 2 is actually arriving on <strong>PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, </strong>and <strong>Xbox Series X</strong> devices in 2023.</p>
<h2>The big additions for the <em>Super Bomberman R</em> sequel Konami is revealing so far include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>A “castle” battle mode where one person can challenge 15 other players with traps and support characters</li>
<li>A creation mode, which Konami says is “essentially a level editor,” that also has a share feature for online play</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of what’s coming back, the story mode is returning (with exploration sequences, base building, defense missions, and boss battles), as well as the 64-person battle royale mode, grand prix, and standard battle.</p>
<p>For me, the castle mode sounds the most intruiging. It’s the kind of thing you’d make up as a kid playing <em>Bomberman<strong> </strong></em>for the first time, but never actually get to play. You can watch it in action below, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://youtu.be/sAugdDnuy2M?t=52"">or at this timestamp in the new trailer</a> (starting roughly 0:45 seconds in).</p>

<p>The first-person shooter has been <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/atomic-heart-has-one-highly-unsettling-clown/"" target=""_blank"">in development for a few years</a>, blending its <em>BioShock </em>influence with Soviet imagery and surreal surroundings.

<p>Now, mutated robots are turning on their creators, and your protagonist Major P-3 is sent in to “minimize consequences” and secure classified info.</p>
<p>It looks like this plays out in a very frenetic manner, as your newfound robotic foes are pretty lethal.

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

		<h2>PC port joins console editions</h2>
<p>Good news for PC shmuppers today, as City Connection <a href=""https://twitter.com/claricedisc/status/1583666682303635456?s=20&amp;t=bWibaHxGQ3WU3ZntQ5m5XA"" target=""_blank"">has announced</a> that Cave shmup <em>Akai Katana Shin</em> will be arriving on Steam on December 15, in alignment with its previously announced re-release on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/caves-akai-katana-shin-is-getting-a-re-release-in-december/"" target=""_blank"">As we have previously reported</a>, <em>Akai Katana Shin</em> originally launched on Xbox 360 in 2011, itself a remaster of Cave’s great 2010 arcade release. In typical Cave fashion the dazzling shmup features adrenaline-pumping, bullet-hell action, a beat-heavy soundtrack, and a melodramatic storyline that features a put-upon people, sick of being sacrificed to the titular totem, rising up against their oppressors in a bid for freedom.</p>
<p>Check out a preview of the re-release from April’s FES 2022 stream. The action starts at 33:30.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/yNZTTM3sZG4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>The new release will feature high-resolution visuals, a widescreen presentation format, and three individual modes to please both <em>Akai Katana</em> veterans and newcomers. <em>Akai Katana Origin</em> will replicate the 2010 arcade in all of its 4:3 glory, <em>Akai Katana Slash </em>will feature revised enemy patterns, new mechanics, and the aforementioned 16:9 screen ratio, while <em>Akai Katana Climax </em>will feature a blend of the previous modes, readjusted for balance. City Connection has noted that <em>Akai Katana Shin</em> will support multiple languages, including English, French, and Spanish.</p>
<p><em>Akai Katana Shin</em> launches December 15 on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. A physical release will follow in 2023 on PS4 and Nintendo Switch only.</p>

Good news for PC shmuppers today, as City Connection has announced that Cave shmup Akai Katana Shin will be arriving on Steam on December 15, in alignment with its previously announced re-release on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.
As we have previously reported, Akai Katana Shin originally launched on Xbox 360 in 2011, itself a remaster of Cave’s great 2010 arcade release. In typical Cave fashion the dazzling shmup features adrenaline-pumping, bullet-hell action, a beat-heavy soundtrack, and a melodramatic storyline that features a put-upon people, sick of being sacrificed to the titular totem, rising up against their oppressors in a bid for freedom.
Check out a preview of the re-release from April’s FES 2022 stream. The action starts at 33:30.

The new release will feature high-resolution visuals, a widescreen presentation format, and three individual modes to please both Akai Katana veterans and newcomers. Akai Katana Origin will replicate the 2010 arcade in all of its 4:3 glory, Akai Katana Slash will feature revised enemy patterns, new mechanics, and the aforementioned 16:9 screen ratio, while Akai Katana Climax will feature a blend of the previous modes, readjusted for balance. City Connection has noted that Akai Katana Shin will support multiple languages, including English, French, and Spanish.
Akai Katana Shin launches December 15 on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. A physical release will follow in 2023 on PS4 and Nintendo Switch only.

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie.

Coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X

Do robots like cake? Will a guillotine cut through steel? These are all valid questions that are on the table in the new action role-playing game from GreedFall developer Spiders.
Steelrising is an automaton take on the French Revolution. The protagonist is Aegis, a robot in female form, who’s a bodyguard to Queen Marie Antoinette. The mission is to “put an end to the massacres carried out by the robot army of King Louis XVI.” 
Spiders says that Steelrising will be much more action-based than its previous games like Greedfall and The Technomancer. There’s an emphasis on fluid transitions from exploring the Parisian streets to getting into fighting. Also, there are upgrades for mobility, durability, and strength, which is seemingly a look at the RPG side of playing in the style you want.
Is this Nier Automata by way of Assassin’s Creed Unity? Probably not at all. But given the two prevalent themes, I’m gonna keep thinking about it that way.
Steelrising is targeting a 2021 launch on PC and next-gen consoles.

 

While you laughing, we're passing, passing away.
So y'all go rest y'all souls,

Y'all know y'all forever got love from them Bone Thugs baby...

<p>Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal is <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-under-uk-regulator-investigation-news/"" target=""_blank"">under investigation</a> by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). As part of those filings, Microsoft says a motivation for the acquisition is to help build out its mobile presence.</p>

<blockquote><p>“The transaction will improve Microsoft’s ability to create a next generation game store which operates across a range of devices, including mobile as a result of the addition of Activision Blizzard’s content. Building on Activision Blizzard’s existing communities of gamers, Xbox will seek to scale the Xbox Store to mobile, attracting gamers to a new Xbox Mobile Platform. Shifting consumers away from the Google Play Store and App Store on mobile devices will, however, require a major shift in consumer behavior. Microsoft hopes that by offering well-known and popular content, gamers will be more inclined to try something new.”</p></blockquote>

		Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs
Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service.

<h2>The Neon Nitrous</h2>
<p>During the recent Nacon Connect live stream, the publisher offered up another slick cinematic trailer for its upcoming racer <em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown.</em> But while the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2RxYui-Jhc"" target=""_blank"">dramatic preview</a> offered up some stylish visuals and dramatic pontificating, it failed to showcase any gameplay for the title, which is currently scheduled to launch on PC and next-gen platforms in 2023.</p>

<p>Developed by veteran studio KT Racing,<em> Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</em> certainly sounds like an incredibly meaty undertaking, with a host of highly realistic licensed vehicles burning rubber through what has been touted as a meticulous “1:1” recreation of the entirety of Hong Kong Island. An emphasis on customization will allow players to not only fine-tune their cars’ appearances to perfection but also customize the appearance of the driver themselves — a feature that takes center stage in the new<em> Solar Crown</em> trailer.</p>
<p>First announced in the summer of 2020, <em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</em> was originally expected to hit the streets <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-hong-kong-release-date-september-22/"" target=""_blank"">this September,</a> but became one of a litany of cross-gen releases pushed back to 2023. It was also confirmed that the <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-delayed-2023-ps4-xbox-one-canceled-nacon/"" target=""_blank"">PS4 and Xbox One editions of the title</a> had been canceled. Now over two years into its development, with a release scheduled for sometime in the coming 18 months, fans are becoming a tad antsy at the persistent rolling out of cinematic trailers, and are starting to wonder when they will finally get to see the ambitious-sounding racer in action.</p>

<h2>Paint Party kicking in right now</h2>
<p>Nintendo’s colorful arena shooter series made its grand return last month, with the arrival of madcap multiplayer release <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-splatoon-3-switch/"" target=""_blank""><em>Splatoon 3</em></a> — And, <a href=""https://www.famitsu.com/"" target=""_blank"">according to new figures in Famitsu</a>, it appears to have had nothing less than the proverbial blockbuster launch, raking in physical and digital sales worldwide and taking the retail market by storm in Japan in particular.</p>
<p>In fact, for September 2021, <em>Splatoon 3</em> sold 2.7 million physical copies in the territory, which accounts for an incredible 69% of all of Japan’s gaming retail for the month in question. Previously, Nintendo had already celebrated <em>Splatoon 3</em> <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/splatoon-3-3-45-million-sales-first-three-days-japan-nintendo-switch/"" target=""_blank"">shifting 3.45 million copies</a> in a mere <em>three days</em>, making it Japan’s fastest-selling Nintendo Switch release ever. <em>Splatoon 3</em> has been the most dominant seller in series’ history, which is unfathomable when you consider hosts Pearl &amp; Marina have taken time out for this entry.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ODI00fgeS0?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>On the hardware front, Japan also shifted a further 500,000 Nintendo Switch units in September, suggesting that <em>Splatoon 3</em> has also been a major platform mover in the territory. And, while Nintendo is not particularly forward in the revelation of its games’ sales figures, we also know that<em> Splatoon 3</em> has also been a success overseas, scoring the series its <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/splatoon-3-sees-series-hit-the-top-of-the-uk-charts-for-the-first-time/"" target=""_blank"">first Number One</a> in the UK sales charts.</p>
<p><em>Splatoon</em>, as a franchise, has gone from strength to strength with each consecutive release. The series’ success goes beyond the engaging gameplay and fun multiplayer action, with <em>Splatoon</em> successfully building a true community of players, as happy to hang around Inkopolis and share emotes and sketches as they are to run around covering the floor and walls in Day-Glo colors. <em>Splatoon</em> may have started out as a typical team shooter, built it has become something more, with fan art, live shows, a healthy competitive scene, and merchandising all helping to grow the franchise into something very special.</p>

<p>If you’re unfamiliar with <em>Record of Agarest War</em>, it’s a strategy RPG with a dating twist. Developed as a collaboration between Compile Heart, Red Entertainment, and Idea Factory, you play as several different protagonists embroiled in conflict.</p>
<p>But the way you navigate through the plot is, well, through generations. As the first protagonist, you can romance and marry one of several party members. Then, your child goes on to be protagonist number 2. This plays out across several generations, with the chosen bride affecting the next hero’s stats and aspects of their appearance.</p>
<p>So yes, fans of <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-fire-emblem-awakening/"" target=""_blank""><em>Fire Emblem: Awakening</em></a>‘s child-unit min-maxing might want to take note. This is a bit of a surprise, as <em>Agarest War </em>has been a more niche series in the pantheon of SRPG discussion. But the genre has been surging, with both <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-triangle-strategy/"" target=""_blank"">new titles</a> and <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/tactics-ogre-reborn-coming-this-november-to-playstation-pc-and-switch/"" target=""_blank"">remasters of old classics</a>. It looks like Aksys wasn’t going to let <em>Agarest War </em>sit on the sidelines for this tactical resurgence.</p>
<p>The news arrived as part of an Aksys announcement <a href=""https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1629481216"" target=""_blank"">stream</a>, alongside several other game announcements. <em>Cuddly Forest Friends </em>is set to arrive on Switch in 2023, <em>Spooky Spirit Shooting Gallery</em> heads to Switch in summer 2023, and <em>Tengoku Struggle -Strayside- </em>is set for Switch in 2024.</p>

		The strategy RPG is making its way to Nintendo’s portable console
Tactics fans keep getting more games, and that now includes a surprising port from Aksys Games. Record of Agarest War is making its way to Nintendo Switch in March 2023.
This strategy RPG originally released in 2007 in Japan, eventually making a western debut on the PlayStation 3 in 2009. It’s since been ported to many other platforms and now, years and years later, it pops up again on Nintendo Switch.
You can check out the trailer here:

<h2>Here’s a few light details</h2>
<p><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/halo-infinite-multiplayer-overview-recap-e3/"" target=""_blank"">So we found out at E3 that <em>Halo Infinite</em> would be doing seasons</a>, but they’re going to be handling them a little differently than some other games. The big gimmick? You can still play “old” battle passes and earn rewards, even after they’ve expired. If this really catches on, it has the chance to inspire the rest of the industry. For now, we have a little bit more info to go on for <em>Halo Infinite</em> season 1 <a href=""https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/inside-infinite-june-2021"" target=""_blank"">thanks to a new blog update</a>.</p>
<p>Live team design director Ryan Paradis stresses that seasons are the “core container or framework” for how content in <em>Infinite</em> works; and I have to say, with a lack of FOMO out of the gate, things are looking promising. Paradis re-iterates that “roughly every three months,” a new season will kick off, with “a ton of updates, content, events, systems, customizations, and progressions.” Naturally, some of that is cosmetics-related. The team notes that they’re committed to changing and addressing feedback going forward, but of course, like any game, how the first couple of months go will dictate how much the playerbase is willing to wait for potential course corrections.</p>
<p>Paradis says that they’re sticking with three months because “it gives players a good amount of time to experience and explore” each season, and that just because content is coming in a three-month cadence, bug fixes will be evergreen. The team also chimes in that “it’s not a grind like it’s a job,” when ranking up seasons. Here’s a bit more info on that: “Almost every week will mix up the activities that are presented to the player. Certain big weeks will feature events that have new activities and specific reward tracks– free reward tracks. We will provide more details on specific events before launch but be on the lookout for a special event type with specific thematic rewards called a “Fracture.” The Battle Pass and other main vectors will supply canon customization. The Fracture and some events will at times lean into things further afield – like the Yoroi armor shown in the multiplayer trailer.”</p>
<p>While direct content hasn’t been shown yet, we do know that Halo Infinite Season 1 is called “Heroes of Reach.” The team also leaves with a fairly big tease: “At the center of our plans is a goal to deeply root your Multiplayer character in the larger Halo universe and give them a vital, active role in the Halo story moving forward. How exactly we’re going to do this in the Seasons and years ahead… Well, we’re not ready to share details yet.”</p>
<p>If they pull off something like <em>Mass Effect 3</em>‘s lore-based multiplayer, or <em>Fortnite</em>‘s ever-growing storyline-based seasonal tint, it could be really cool. For now, all we really know is that it’s kind of following a battle pass system where you can replay old passes. That could be good enough.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<h2><em>Dragonflight</em> is out on November 28</h2>
<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23867915/the-dragonflight-pre-expansion-patch-phase-1-is-now-live"">The time has come</a> for the <em>World of Warcraft</em> pre-<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/world-of-warcraft-expansion-dragonflight-here-are-the-details/""><em>Dragonflight</em></a> expansion patch, much to the delight of lapsed players everywhere. Let’s talk about the broad strokes before the actual expansion launches on November 28.</p>
<h2>Here’s a quick rundown of the pre-<em>Dragonflight</em> expansion patch:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The talent system has been revamped, and here’s the biggest change: “Change your talents anywhere, for free. Switching talents no longer requires being in a rested area or using tomes. However, you can’t change talents during combat, Mythic+ runs, and active PvP matches.”</li>
<li>You can play Mage, Priest, and Rogue classes with all races</li>
<li>Full UI/HUD customization is in, by default, without the help of mods</li>
<li>Season 4 ends this week, with a “post-season” lull until the expansion arrives</li>
</ul>
<p>After all this, the “second phase” of the pre-expansion patch will launch on November 15. At that point the Evoker class will be available, as well as a new zone (Forbidden Reach), the Uldaman: Legacy of Tyr dungeon (just in time for the new <em>God of War</em>), and the typical pre-expansion in-game events.</p>
<p><em>Shadowlands</em>, the current <em>WoW</em> expansion, had a number of things working against it. A lot of the playerbase was fed up with <em>WoW</em>, fed up with Activision-Blizzard (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-timeline-industry-ceo-bobby-kotick-report/"">especially when all this came out</a>)…and of course, it was also at a time <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker/"">when <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker/""> was </a><strong><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker/"">really, really good</a>. </strong>Maybe <em>Dragonflight</em> can turn things around, leading into the Microsoft aqusition. Or maybe not. With modern Blizzard, you never know what’s going to happen.</p>
<p>If you want to dig further, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23814291/dragonflight-pre-expansion-update-notes-now-live?cmsMode=live"">you can find the full patch notes here</a>.</p>

	<div>
		<h2>What do you mean ‘Who’s Captain Tomaday?’</h2>
<p>The retro-lovers over at QuByte Interactive have announced a brand new compilation spotlighting the works of lesser-remembered ’80s/’90s developer Visco Corporation — Now in development for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7lDgAJ63Uc&amp;t"" target=""_blank""><em>Visco Collection</em></a> offers a look back at some old-school arcade/Neo Geo releases.</p>
<p>The new compilation bundles together seven titles from the Visco archives, freshly emulated by indie developer PixelHeart. The game featured are Neo Geo shmup <em>Andro Dunos</em> (1992); futuristic sports game <em>Flip Shot</em> (1997) and its sequel <em>Bang Bead</em> (2000); side-scrolling actioner<em> Ganryu</em> (1999); rally racer<em> Neo Drift Out</em> (1996), soccer title<em> Goal! Goal! Goal!</em> (1995); and finally the bizarre, tomato-based shmup <em>Captain Tomaday</em> (1999).</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7lDgAJ63Uc?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>

Dragonflight is out on November 28
The time has come for the World of Warcraft pre-Dragonflight expansion patch, much to the delight of lapsed players everywhere. Let’s talk about the broad strokes before the actual expansion launches on November 28.
Here’s a quick rundown of the pre-Dragonflight expansion patch:

The talent system has been revamped, and here’s the biggest change: “Change your talents anywhere, for free. Switching talents no longer requires being in a rested area or using tomes. However, you can’t change talents during combat, Mythic+ runs, and active PvP matches.”
You can play Mage, Priest, and Rogue classes with all races
Full UI/HUD customization is in, by default, without the help of mods
Season 4 ends this week, with a “post-season” lull until the expansion arrives

After all this, the “second phase” of the pre-expansion patch will launch on November 15. At that point the Evoker class will be available, as well as a new zone (Forbidden Reach), the Uldaman: Legacy of Tyr dungeon (just in time for the new God of War), and the typical pre-expansion in-game events.
Shadowlands, the current WoW expansion, had a number of things working against it. A lot of the playerbase was fed up with WoW, fed up with Activision-Blizzard (especially when all this came out)…and of course, it was also at a time when Final Fantasy XIV was really, really good. Maybe Dragonflight can turn things around, leading into the Microsoft aqusition. Or maybe not. With modern Blizzard, you never know what’s going to happen.
If you want to dig further, you can find the full patch notes here.

		What do you mean ‘Who’s Captain Tomaday?’
The retro-lovers over at QuByte Interactive have announced a brand new compilation spotlighting the works of lesser-remembered ’80s/’90s developer Visco Corporation — Now in development for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, Visco Collection offers a look back at some old-school arcade/Neo Geo releases.
The new compilation bundles together seven titles from the Visco archives, freshly emulated by indie developer PixelHeart. The game featured are Neo Geo shmup Andro Dunos (1992); futuristic sports game Flip Shot (1997) and its sequel Bang Bead (2000); side-scrolling actioner Ganryu (1999); rally racer Neo Drift Out (1996), soccer title Goal! Goal! Goal! (1995); and finally the bizarre, tomato-based shmup Captain Tomaday (1999).

No further details have been announced, so we do not know whether the collection will include online play, save states, a museum mode, or any of the other features typical of other retro collections — such as Capcom Arcade Stadium. There are some fun titles bundled here, though the only one I remember seeing quite commonly on the scene is Neo Drift Out. Importantly, however, Captain Tomaday is finally about to get his day in the sun, enjoying the fame and fortune that eluded the winged fruit during his initial run — smothered by the encroaching concerns of The Millennium Bug, no doubt.
Visco Collection is currently in development for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

<p>The Game Awards was an exhausting marathon blur of game reveals, ads, and the occasional award. After nearly four hours blogging, I logged off thinking that only one new game actually made an impression on me: <em>The Callisto Protocol</em>. </p>
<p><em>The Callisto Protocol</em> is described as a “single-player, third-person, story-driven, survival horror game.” It has <em>Dead Space</em> DNA as the developer’s CEO and founder, Glen Schofield, used to work on EA’s renowned horror franchise. The cinematic trailer is simply stunning. It’s extremely early and we haven’t seen anything in-engine or actual gameplay, but all the pieces look in place thus far.</p>
<p>There’s a weird and ill-fitting piece in the mix, though. <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-wants-to-be-the-scariest-next-gen-horror-game-ever"" target=""_blank"">IGN</a> interviewed Schofield following the announcement, and he confirmed that <em>The Callisto Protocol</em> takes place within the <em>PUBG</em> universe. The tactical shooter battle royale will have a monster-focused horror game that’s set in space as part of its official lore.</p>
<p>The business-oriented answer to this riddle is that <em>Callisto Protocol</em> developer Striking Distance is part of the Krafton publishing group who also owns PUBG Corp. Krafton seemingly wants its games tied together, all grouped up under a tidy umbrella. Schofield says “<span>The funny thing is, I came in with this story when I went and met with the <em>PUBG</em> people for the first time and started talking about [<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>] and building a studio. I presented this game to them, and so what we did was we made it fit within the <em>PUBG</em> storyline.”</span></p>
<p>But, to be clear, <em>The Callisto Protocol</em> is set 300 years after <em>PUBG</em>; takes place in a prison in space; is all about monsters; and is definitely a true third-person horror game. The actual connection to <em>PUBG</em> seems tenuous at best. Taking all that into consideration, the only real question on everyone’s mind is: <em>Why?</em></p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

<div>
<h2>The bots are back</h2>
<p>Following yesterday’s appearance in the Xbox &amp; Bethesda E3 showcase, 343 Industries showcased a little more of <em>Halo Infinite</em>‘s multiplayer today in a new overview. And we actually got a fair bit of info, not just in gameplay, but in what’s coming for the new look of <em>Halo </em>multiplayer.</p>
<p><em>Halo Infinite</em> multiplayer will be a free-to-play experience (as has been <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/halo-infinite-120-fps-multiplayer-series-x-holiday-release/"" target=""_blank"">previously announced</a>) for PC and Xbox. Alongside what you might expect from a usual <em>Halo</em> experience, like power weapons and vehicles, there are some new tools for destruction too; the grappling hook obviously changes up momentum, and you can also see points where the player grapples a hammer or power-up to themselves to pick up.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-O7OuliQRY?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>Equipment is also back, as is the Razorback, the Warthog’s sturdier cousin. The back of the Razorback has a compartment where you can stash power weapons, detached turrets, or even fusion coils or objectives.</p>
<p>What appealed the most to me was the Academy, a new location within multiplayer that acts as both a tutorial area and a warm-up range for playing. These features have become gradually more and more commonplace in games, and seeing <em>Halo</em> implement onboarding tools, built-in warm-up areas, and bots for <em>Infinite </em>is a good sign to me.</p>
<p>343 Industries also confirms there are no loot boxes, and there will be a Battle Pass, though it will never be taken away. As described in the video, it sounds like there will be Battle Passes with seasonal updates, but Passes won’t be “taken away.” As new ones come out, you’ll be able to purchase old ones and elect which Passes to put progression towards, which is a nice way of ensuring a good skin or cosmetic doesn’t pass players by.</p>
<p>Overall, today’s showcase seemed like a solid overview of what’s coming in the new <em>Halo </em>multiplayer suite. <em>Halo Infinite </em>is still aiming for a holiday launch later this year on Xbox and PC.</p>

The bots are back
Following yesterday’s appearance in the Xbox &amp; Bethesda E3 showcase, 343 Industries showcased a little more of Halo Infinite‘s multiplayer today in a new overview. And we actually got a fair bit of info, not just in gameplay, but in what’s coming for the new look of Halo multiplayer.
Halo Infinite multiplayer will be a free-to-play experience (as has been previously announced) for PC and Xbox. Alongside what you might expect from a usual Halo experience, like power weapons and vehicles, there are some new tools for destruction too; the grappling hook obviously changes up momentum, and you can also see points where the player grapples a hammer or power-up to themselves to pick up.

Equipment is also back, as is the Razorback, the Warthog’s sturdier cousin. The back of the Razorback has a compartment where you can stash power weapons, detached turrets, or even fusion coils or objectives.
What appealed the most to me was the Academy, a new location within multiplayer that acts as both a tutorial area and a warm-up range for playing. These features have become gradually more and more commonplace in games, and seeing Halo implement onboarding tools, built-in warm-up areas, and bots for Infinite is a good sign to me.
343 Industries also confirms there are no loot boxes, and there will be a Battle Pass, though it will never be taken away. As described in the video, it sounds like there will be Battle Passes with seasonal updates, but Passes won’t be “taken away.” As new ones come out, you’ll be able to purchase old ones and elect which Passes to put progression towards, which is a nice way of ensuring a good skin or cosmetic doesn’t pass players by.
Overall, today’s showcase seemed like a solid overview of what’s coming in the new Halo multiplayer suite. Halo Infinite is still aiming for a holiday launch later this year on Xbox and PC.

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

<p>Something<em> very</em> special from the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster takes time out from its recent Namco obsession to deliver not only a Tecmo title, but a fun, silly, and particularly obscure one at that — Available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch its forgotten fighter <em>Angel Eyes!</em></p>
<p>Released to Japanese arcades in 1996, <em>Angel Eyes</em> — or to give it its full title<em> Tōkidenshō Angel Eyes</em> — is a super cult 2D fighter that was renowned for sporting an All Anime Gal cast of scrappers. A selection of fun character tropes, including a school girl, a volleyball player, a kunoichi, an arrogant “ojou” woman, and a young girl with a giant teddy bear (<a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dnf-duel-enchantress-trailer-nexon-fighting-games-arcsys/"" target=""_blank"">predating Enchantress by several decades</a>), fight it out in cute ‘n’ colorful action, set against the backdrop of some equally strange locations, such as a fun fair, and a medieval castle!</p>
<p>Check out the cute ‘n’ crazy carnage in the video below, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR2L0bPxY_M"" target=""_blank"">courtesy of YouTuber Colmarr.</a></p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/hR2L0bPxY_M?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Angel Eyes</em>, despite its seeming irrelevance, had some surprisingly prescient ideas. Not only is it one of the first-ever “all women” fighting games, but it is also one of the first 2D fighters to feature a heavy slant on juggles and air combos. Perhaps its funniest and most bizarre mechanic, however, is reserved for the so-called “reverse combo correction” system, which actually<em> increases</em> damage the longer a combo goes on — rather than scales it back. And thus, players with one or two fairly solid combos can find themselves taking down their opponents in a manner of seconds.</p>
<p>You thought <em>Street Fighter V</em> was “three mistakes to death”? Try “one mistake to death”!</p>
<p>Despite its simplistic nature and dopey mechanics, Angel Eyes is, understandably, not without its charm. Though it would receive a JPN PlayStation point in 1997, the series would quietly disappear into the annals of fighting game history. Still, it’s lovely to see it again. And, as opposed to a lot of the Arcade Archives releases, <em>Angel Eyes</em> is a title that actually requires archiving, due to its obscure, rare nature.</p>
<p><em>Angel Eyes</em> is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.</p>

<h2>It’s also moving to a new engine</h2>
<p>Konami announced today <em>eFootball </em>is its new soccer game, as the successor to <em>PES</em>, and it’s got some changes in store. <em>eFootball </em>is coming to both Xbox and PlayStation console generations, as well as PC, this fall, and it’s switching up much of its approach.</p>
<p>Konami’s <em>eFootball</em> will be a digital-only, free-to-play soccer game. The plan for <em>eFootball </em>is to provide a “fair and balanced experience” for players across all platforms, though more about gameplay and the online modes will be revealed later in August.</p>
<p>Because it’s a digital-only title, <em>eFootball</em> will also be receiving content updates over time after it goes live. Local matches between FC Barcelona, Juventus, FC Bayern, Manchester United, and others will be available for free at launch. In the future, “certain game modes” will be sold as optional DLC.</p>
<p><em>eFootball </em>will also have full cross-play support post-launch. The soccer experience is also coming to mobile on Android and iOS, though at a later date.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>eFootball </em>heads into the new console generation with a new engine. Konami will be implementing the Unreal Engine for this game, which it says has allowed the team to massively overhaul player expression.</p>
<p>It sounds like a big overhaul for Konami’s soccer series, as it continues to compete with Electronic Arts’ annual <em>FIFA </em>offering. The company had surprise-dropped a “<a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/konami-new-football-game-online-test-surprise-drop/"" target=""_blank"">New Football Game Online Performance Test</a>” last month, in order for players to help test its online matchmaking and servers. Now, it looks like Konami’s offering is looking to offer an alternative, both in how it plays and in how it rolls out over time.</p>
<p>Whether Konami’s <em>eFootball</em> can square off against <em>FIFA</em>, we’ll see. EA is likely set to discuss more about its own soccer series tomorrow during this year’s <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/ea-play-live-will-return-in-july/"" target=""_blank"">EA Play Live event</a>, as it also <a href=""https://www.ea.com/ea-play-live/spotlights/fifa-22-spotlight"" target=""_blank"">hosted a recent spotlight on this year’s game</a>.

<h2><em>Overwatch</em> died so that <em>Overwatch 2</em> could live</h2>
<p>At launch, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-overwatch/""><em>Overwatch</em></a> was a powerhouse. It was the first new real IP from Blizzard in a long time, and from beta through the first few years, it was widely beloved by many, and even lead to a burgeoning (though late) eSports scene. But then the troubles started.</p>
<p><em>Overwatch</em> became staler as the team re-used the same events, and slowed with new hero releases. Critical team members left, and Blizzard was turned upside-down by some <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-timeline-industry-ceo-bobby-kotick-report/"">egregious activities at the company</a>. Many games at Blizzard, <em>Overwatch</em> included, haven’t recovered from everything that happened.</p>
<p>Can <em>Overwatch 2</em> bring the series back into the forefront? Well, it depends on a few things.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Overwatch-review-1.jpg?resize=640%2C287&amp;ssl=1"" alt=""Early Access Review: Overwatch 2 1"" /></p>
<p><strong><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/""><em>Overwatch 2</em></a> (PC [reviewed], PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X)<br />Developer: Blizzard</strong><br />
<strong>Publisher: Blizzard</strong><br />
<strong>Released: October 4, 2022</strong><br />
<strong>MSRP: Free-to-play (with microtransactions/season pass)</strong></p>
<p>So what’s different? Here are the biggest changes for <em>Overwatch 2</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Overwatch</em> is now a 5v5 game, down from 6v6</li>
<li>Three new characters are out at launch (Sojourn, Junker Queen, Kiriko)</li>
<li>A new mode called Push is in (which asks two teams to fight over an objective), and six new maps</li>
<li>With the move to free-to-play, there’s a season pass now with a premium tier</li>
</ul>
<p>Thankfully, all of my prior stuff from <em>Overwatch</em> transferred in, even in the pre-release period. All the old cast members now have an additional “<em>Overwatch 2</em>” skin, which was unlocked by default. Although the rollout and complete wipe of the original game isn’t ideal for a number of reasons, at least this part is being done right: and the same goes for cross-progression going into <em>Overwatch 2</em>.</p>
<p>When launching into a game though, I found myself still getting used to the 5v5 format, as well as some new adjustments. A launch patch will be altering several aspects of the game, including a movement/reload buff for damage role players after they get a kill, and all heroes will refund up to 30% ultimate power on hero swap.</p>
<p>I’m sure some folks are going to butt up against it, but to me, most of the alterations felt natural. Many of the changes are a sleek way to keep the game fresh, albeit at the cost of erasing the original game from existence. Now the team has the tough challenge of rebalancing this brand new format in perpetuity (or at least until <em>Overwatch 3</em> erases <em>Overwatch 2</em>).</p>
<p>The new cast members help add to that new sense of tactical nuance. <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-2-beta-impressions-is-it-worth-it/"">I talked quite a bit about Sojourn in my beta impressions</a>, and I still feel roughly the same about her going into launch (she’s by no means going to be my main, but it’s fun to see her in games mixing things up). Junker Queen, however, brings a much-needed tank into the mix, and has an attitude to boot. Her aggressive style is going to be really appealing to a lot of players, and her commanding shout (which buffs nearby teammates) is a cool callback to barbarian/warrior playstyles. Her voice actor is also on point and fits the character well.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LGgqyer-qr4?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>Kiriko is a pretty cool support character, focusing on talismans (which can heal) and kunai as her primary source of damage. The classic intuitive <em>Overwatch</em> design is still present, as she holds her talismans on the left side of the screen (left-click) and her kunai on the right (right-click). She also has a snap-use protection charm that can make a group of teammates invulnerable for a brief moment; and sports killer traversal skills with a teleport that goes directly to an ally, and wall-climbing capabilities.</p>
<p>Her ultimate is a bit like Hanzo’s Dragonstrike, but this time it’s a kitsune that grants beneficial effects for her team. She’s interesting because she can change a single push with a well-timed invulnerability charm and her ultimate. Plus, I love climbing around every level, including all the old ones, with her wall-crawling. For me, the gameplay mostly checks out. Now it’s time to venture into darker territory.</p>
<p>The Season Pass reward track is actually much simpler than the confusing pre-launch info rollout made it seem. So presently, at least for the first season, there’s a single “battle pass” that has 80 tiers. Free players can get some rewards from it, and premium players will unlock things at every track. Purchasing levels (which some passes allow or disallow, depending on the company) is an option. Here is everything that comprises the first <em>Overwatch</em> 2 season pass free track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newest support hero, Kiriko (for new players who won’t have her already)</li>
<li>2 Epic Skins</li>
<li>1 Weapon Charm</li>
<li>2 Souvenirs</li>
<li>1 Highlight Intro</li>
<li>14 additional items (emotes, victory poses, name cards, sprays, player icons, etc.)</li>
<li>Prestige Tier Titles (8 earnable titles available only after completing the entire pass)</li>
</ul>

<li>30+ additional cosmetic rewards</li>
</ul>
<p>To buy into the premium pass each season, it’ll cost you 1000 Overwatch Coins, or $10. Characters, “if they are included in a season pass” (not all of them will have one, as the current plan is offering characters in Season 1, Season 2, Season 4, and Season 6), will be unlocked at level 55 on the free track [this season it’s linked to Kiriko], and are unlocked automatically after buying the premium track.

For a free player, slowly clawing your way up the pass to level 55 to gain access to a new character is excruciating, even if Blizzard is locking them from ranked play for a token few weeks. For hardcore players, it seems like you’ll be dropping $10 a few times a year (with a nine-week cadence announced for seasons), which gives you instant hero access.</p>
<p>Then there’s the other wrinkle of brand new players needing to essentially start over from square one: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-2-new-players-unlock-original-roster-blizzard-news/"">including the requirement of unlocking the full original core cast</a>.

Overwatch died so that Overwatch 2 could live
At launch, Overwatch was a powerhouse. It was the first new real IP from Blizzard in a long time, and from beta through the first few years, it was widely beloved by many, and even lead to a burgeoning (though late) eSports scene. But then the troubles started.
Overwatch became staler as the team re-used the same events, and slowed with new hero releases. Critical team members left, and Blizzard was turned upside-down by some egregious activities at the company. Many games at Blizzard, Overwatch included, haven’t recovered from everything that happened.
Can Overwatch 2 bring the series back into the forefront? Well, it depends on a few things.

Overwatch 2 (PC [reviewed], PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X)Developer: Blizzard
Publisher: Blizzard
Released: October 4, 2022
MSRP: Free-to-play (with microtransactions/season pass)
So what’s different? Here are the biggest changes for Overwatch 2:

Overwatch is now a 5v5 game, down from 6v6
Three new characters are out at launch (Sojourn, Junker Queen, Kiriko)
A new mode called Push is in (which asks two teams to fight over an objective), and six new maps
With the move to free-to-play, there’s a season pass now with a premium tier

Thankfully, all of my prior stuff from Overwatch transferred in, even in the pre-release period. All the old cast members now have an additional “Overwatch 2” skin, which was unlocked by default. Although the rollout and complete wipe of the original game isn’t ideal for a number of reasons, at least this part is being done right: and the same goes for cross-progression going into Overwatch 2.
When launching into a game though, I found myself still getting used to the 5v5 format, as well as some new adjustments. A launch patch will be altering several aspects of the game, including a movement/reload buff for damage role players after they get a kill, and all heroes will refund up to 30% ultimate power on hero swap.
I’m sure some folks are going to butt up against it, but to me, most of the alterations felt natural. Many of the changes are a sleek way to keep the game fresh, albeit at the cost of erasing the original game from existence. Now the team has the tough challenge of rebalancing this brand new format in perpetuity (or at least until Overwatch 3 erases Overwatch 2).
The new cast members help add to that new sense of tactical nuance. I talked quite a bit about Sojourn in my beta impressions, and I still feel roughly the same about her going into launch (she’s by no means going to be my main, but it’s fun to see her in games mixing things up). Junker Queen, however, brings a much-needed tank into the mix, and has an attitude to boot. Her aggressive style is going to be really appealing to a lot of players, and her commanding shout (which buffs nearby teammates) is a cool callback to barbarian/warrior playstyles. Her voice actor is also on point and fits the character well.

Kiriko is a pretty cool support character, focusing on talismans (which can heal) and kunai as her primary source of damage. The classic intuitive Overwatch design is still present, as she holds her talismans on the left side of the screen (left-click) and her kunai on the right (right-click). She also has a snap-use protection charm that can make a group of teammates invulnerable for a brief moment; and sports killer traversal skills with a teleport that goes directly to an ally, and wall-climbing capabilities.
Her ultimate is a bit like Hanzo’s Dragonstrike, but this time it’s a kitsune that grants beneficial effects for her team. She’s interesting because she can change a single push with a well-timed invulnerability charm and her ultimate. Plus, I love climbing around every level, including all the old ones, with her wall-crawling. For me, the gameplay mostly checks out. Now it’s time to venture into darker territory.
The Season Pass reward track is actually much simpler than the confusing pre-launch info rollout made it seem. So presently, at least for the first season, there’s a single “battle pass” that has 80 tiers. Free players can get some rewards from it, and premium players will unlock things at every track. Purchasing levels (which some passes allow or disallow, depending on the company) is an option. Here is everything that comprises the first Overwatch 2 season pass free track:

Newest support hero, Kiriko (for new players who won’t have her already)
2 Epic Skins
1 Weapon Charm
2 Souvenirs
1 Highlight Intro
14 additional items (emotes, victory poses, name cards, sprays, player icons, etc.)
Prestige Tier Titles (8 earnable titles available only after completing the entire pass)

And here’s what you get from the premium track:

Immediate access to Kiriko
20% XP Battle Pass Boost
1 Mythic Skin
5 Legendary Skins and 1 Epic Skin
3 Play of the Game Intros
4 Weapon Charms
3 Emotes
3 Souvenirs
6 Poses
6 Name Cards
30+ additional cosmetic rewards

To buy into the premium pass each season, it’ll cost you 1000 Overwatch Coins, or $10. Characters, “if they are included in a season pass” (not all of them will have one, as the current plan is offering characters in Season 1, Season 2, Season 4, and Season 6), will be unlocked at level 55 on the free track [this season it’s linked to Kiriko], and are unlocked automatically after buying the premium track. There’s also a shop with a limited number of items that can be purchased directly for coins. Phew! That’s most of it. Annoyed yet?
So there’s a lot of ways you can look at this. In short, it’s a lot like the Fortnite season pass system Epic created years ago, but worse. In Fortnite, players can earn premium currency directly from the pass itself, which will pay for the next pass. In Overwatch 2, you can earn coins elsewhere, but it’s expected that you’ll be able to pay for at least every other pass, roughly.

Then there’s the other wrinkle of brand new players needing to essentially start over from square one: including the requirement of unlocking the full original core cast. Plus, an SMS Protect link will be required at launch. It was a strange “this deal is getting worse all the time” rollout of information, especially so close to the arrival of the game.
Everyone is going to respond differently, and I’m kind of in the middle. At face value, the season pass system is fiddly. The rewards are not really high value, the lack of currency in the pass in 2022 is disappointing, and there’s nothing unique or inherently “Overwatch” about this.

<h2>PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions are locked in too</h2>
<p>The next game in the <em>Tales </em>series is finally ready to set a date. <em>Tales of Arise </em>has been locked in for a Sept. 10 release date, and it’s also arriving with PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions alongside PS4, Xbox One, and PC.</p>
<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.famitsu.com/news/202104/21218269.html"">Famitsu</a> revealed a wealth of new info about the new entry in the <em>Tales </em>series this morning. Alongside new screenshots showcasing two additional characters that seem to be joining the party—a previously-teased mage character and a martial arts fighter—there are also two new trailers. The first is the launch date trailer (in English via IGN):</p>

<p>It wasn’t just cinematics, though. A second, longer trailer from Famitsu showcases a few minutes of  gameplay from <em>Tales of Arise</em>. Here, we can see the new look of the series in motion, from overworld exploration and dialogue to battles.</p>
<p>Seeing how the team has managed to make it look completely new, with an overhauled style and systems, while still retaining the structures that make it feel very <em>Tales</em>-like is fascinating. I can make out what seem like Artes, and even the overworld seems hazily similar to other <em>Tales </em>games, but with a revitalized feel to it.</p>
<p><em>Tales of Arise </em>had <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/tales-of-arise-is-slipping-out-of-2020-and-it-doesn-t-have-a-launch-window-in-mind-595465.phtml"">previously been indefinitely delayed</a>, and while the studio had <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.usgamer.net/articles/talking-to-tales-of-arises-producer-about-how-the-series-is-pivoting-to-win-over-western-gamers"">emphasized its new approach to the <em>Tales </em>series</a>, not much was seen of it. Now, with both a release date, new platforms, and a gameplay video all out in the open, the new <em>Tales </em>is feeling much more real. I’m very much looking forward to September.</p>

<p>Something<em> very</em> special from the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster takes time out from its recent Namco obsession to deliver not only a Tecmo title, but a fun, silly, and particularly obscure one at that — Available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch its forgotten fighter <em>Angel Eyes!</em></p>
<p>Released to Japanese arcades in 1996, <em>Angel Eyes</em> — or to give it its full title<em> Tōkidenshō Angel Eyes</em> — is a super cult 2D fighter that was renowned for sporting an All Anime Gal cast of scrappers. A selection of fun character tropes, including a school girl, a volleyball player, a kunoichi, an arrogant “ojou” woman, and a young girl with a giant teddy bear (<a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dnf-duel-enchantress-trailer-nexon-fighting-games-arcsys/"" target=""_blank"">predating Enchantress by several decades</a>), fight it out in cute ‘n’ colorful action, set against the backdrop of some equally strange locations, such as a fun fair, and a medieval castle!</p>
<p>Check out the cute ‘n’ crazy carnage in the video below, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR2L0bPxY_M"" target=""_blank"">courtesy of YouTuber Colmarr.</a></p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/hR2L0bPxY_M?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Angel Eyes</em>, despite its seeming irrelevance, had some surprisingly prescient ideas. Not only is it one of the first-ever “all women” fighting games, but it is also one of the first 2D fighters to feature a heavy slant on juggles and air combos. Perhaps its funniest and most bizarre mechanic, however, is reserved for the so-called “reverse combo correction” system, which actually<em> increases</em> damage the longer a combo goes on — rather than scales it back. And thus, players with one or two fairly solid combos can find themselves taking down their opponents in a manner of seconds.</p>
<p>You thought <em>Street Fighter V</em> was “three mistakes to death”? Try “one mistake to death”!</p>
<p>Despite its simplistic nature and dopey mechanics, Angel Eyes is, understandably, not without its charm. Though it would receive a JPN PlayStation point in 1997, the series would quietly disappear into the annals of fighting game history. Still, it’s lovely to see it again. And, as opposed to a lot of the Arcade Archives releases, <em>Angel Eyes</em> is a title that actually requires archiving, due to its obscure, rare nature.</p>
<p><em>Angel Eyes</em> is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.</p>

It’s Marvel, baby!
Yes, Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 has been freed. Arcade cabinet producer Arcade1Up has revealed a Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 arcade cabinet, packing the 3-on-3 fighter and many other Marvel arcade classics into one cab.
The cabinet includes eight games, and has built-in Wi-Fi. So not only is Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 back and playable in its first legit form since the Xbox 360 version, it will also have online play. The cab will also have exclusive side panel art, a matching custom riser, and a light-up marquee.

Alongside Marvel, there are seven other games packed into the cabinet as well. Here’s the lineup:

<h2><em>Shadowlands</em> created a lull, so fans are expecting a lot</h2>
<p>Blizzard has announced the <em>World of Warcraft Dragonflight</em> expansion today <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3nPloFgHkM"">during their “expansion reveal” stream</a>: two months after their canceled BlizzCon 2022 event would have taken place (the opening for today even had BlizzCon nostalgia shots in it). <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/a-complete-ranking-of-every-era-of-world-of-warcraft-as-voted-by-our-community/"">This is the <strong>ninth</strong> expansion for <em>World of Warcraft</em></a>, a feat in and of itself.</p>
<p>Presented by Holly Longdale (lead producer <em>WoW Classic</em>), John Hight (franchise general manager), and Ion Hazzikostas (game director and VP), the roundtable of devs noted that they “needed to do better,” and incorporated feedback into the future of the game. They reiterated cross-faction play is part of update 9.2.5, as a way to give people more chances to play with one another, as a “closing chapter for <em>Shadowlands</em>.”</p>
<p><em>Dragonflight</em>, however, is the near future. It’ll be “going back to Azeroth,” and plays off of events from thousands of years ago. “<a href=""https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/dragonflight-expansion"" target=""_blank"">The awakening of the Dragon Isles</a>” will be the key component, which has “removed the [convenient] concealment” of the region that cordoned it off from the rest of Azeroth.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>An all-new playable mail-wearing race</strong> — Dracthyr (with skin/hair/jewelry customization), which has a secondary human form that can also be customized.</li>
<li>The Dracthyr will also use <strong>the Evoker [hero] class (which has a healer spec and a new “hold buttons to charge a spell” mechanic)</strong> exclusively — which will start at level 58 with a new starter zone.</li>
<li>The expansion will consist of five zones: four standard leveling zones (the roiling Waking Shores; the vast Ohn’ahran Plains; the stark Azure Span; and ancient, majestic Thaldraszus), and the new starter zone — you will progress to <strong>the new cap of level 70</strong> here.</li>
<li>The <em>WoW</em> core system will be “overhauled,” including the talent system (with bigger talent trees focused on “granularity” of old expansions pre-<em>Pandaria</em>), the UI (with more customization without needing to rely on add-ons), and professions (which will deliver on fantasy as a crafter; I see big influences from <em>FFXIV </em>here).</li>
<li>Dragon riding will feature “momentum, and dive bombs” to allow for a more dynamic version of flight, with a “customizable dragon mount at the start.”</li>
<li>Duck critters will be in the new expansion areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the <em>initial reception</em> to the current expansion (<em>Shadowlands</em>) was fairly positive, fans have turned on it over time. Not only did the game itself fail to compel people to log in on a constant basis, fail to deliver interesting updates, and fumble storylines for long term classic <em>Warcraft</em> characters; but <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/activision-blizzard-lawyer-allege-interference-governor-california-office/"">the series of Activision Blizzard scandals</a> have soured the perception of the company as a whole, leading fans to leave in droves for <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>.</p>
<p>A lot of pressure is on <em>Dragonflight</em> to deliver the goods and actually shake up <em>WoW</em> in a meaningful way <em>that also</em> goes over well with long-term fans; many of which are the lifeblood of the game. It’s an unenviable position from a developmental standpoint, but there are many inspirations to draw from as well, including the game’s own history.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Microsoft and Blizzard deal will apparently close, according to the former, in the “fiscal year of 2023,” which begins in July of 2022 and ends at the end of June 2023. So by the time <em>World of Warcraft</em> <em>Dragonflight</em> arrives, it could be the first <em>WoW</em> expansion under Microsoft’s umbrella.</p>

Shadowlands created a lull, so fans are expecting a lot
Blizzard has announced the World of Warcraft Dragonflight expansion today during their “expansion reveal” stream: two months after their canceled BlizzCon 2022 event would have taken place (the opening for today even had BlizzCon nostalgia shots in it). This is the ninth expansion for World of Warcraft, a feat in and of itself.
Presented by Holly Longdale (lead producer WoW Classic), John Hight (franchise general manager), and Ion Hazzikostas (game director and VP), the roundtable of devs noted that they “needed to do better,” and incorporated feedback into the future of the game. They reiterated cross-faction play is part of update 9.2.5, as a way to give people more chances to play with one another, as a “closing chapter for Shadowlands.”
Dragonflight, however, is the near future. It’ll be “going back to Azeroth,” and plays off of events from thousands of years ago. “The awakening of the Dragon Isles” will be the key component, which has “removed the [convenient] concealment” of the region that cordoned it off from the rest of Azeroth.

<p>There’s a lot of missing information regarding Hellena Taylor and her recent trending <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://twitter.com/hellenataylor/status/1581289084718227456"">Twitter videos</a> calling on fans to boycott<em> Bayonetta 3</em>.

<p>PlatinumGames has had an odd few years.

Now, this Hellena Taylor controversy is just more signs that things aren’t going too well at Platinum. Although I’d love to be wrong.</p>

Platinum Games really needs a win
Welcome back! It is a new Tuesday, which means tonight there will be a new episode of Spot Dodge: A Live Nintendo Podcast exclusively on Destructoid. Topics: The crew discusses the recent controversy regarding PlatinumGames’ “insulting” pay offer of $4,000 USD to veteran Bayonetta voice actress Hellena Taylor for the third installment. Brett M and Brett L also share their thoughts on A Plague Tale: Requiem. Spoilers: It’s one of the best games of the year.

<h2>2B getting a lil’ foxy</h2>
<p>We are just a few weeks out from the Nintendo Switch port of the exciting and highly melodramatic <em>NieR: Automata</em>. Publisher Square Enix has released <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiWGORJRNr0"" target=""_blank"">a new trailer</a> showing off the PlatinumGames-produced action-adventure, also taking the time to spotlight some exclusive new DLC content.</p>

<p>The Switch port, titled <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/square-enix-confirms-nier-automata-switch-is-1080p-docked-30-fps/"" target=""_blank""><em>NieR: Automata — End of YORHA Edition</em></a>, will already feature all of the post-release skins, gear, and other additional items featured in its PlayStation, PC, and Xbox brethren, but will also include the all-new “6C2P4A118680823” DLC pack, which will include new character costumes for protagonists 2B, 9S, and A2, as well as new looks for their respective pods. The DLC includes outfits based on the recent remake <em>NieR: Replicant</em>, as well as some traditional Japanese garb, including samurai and kunoichi gear, complete with fox masks.</p>
<p><em>NieR: Automata</em> first launched on PS4 back in 2017 and has slowly gathered a larger and larger audience in the ensuing years. The dizzying hack ‘n’ slash title tells the story of a war between mankind and the machines, and the fates of the sentient androids that are placed right in the center of the interplanetary conflict. <em>NieR: Automata</em> has won praise for its bleak, dystopian world, dramatic storytelling, smart enemy design, and its <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/nier-automata-end-of-yorha-nintendo-switch-2b-trailer/"" target=""_blank"">unforgettable protagonist, 2B</a>, who has fast become a gaming icon.

2B getting a lil’ foxy
We are just a few weeks out from the Nintendo Switch port of the exciting and highly melodramatic NieR: Automata. Publisher Square Enix has released a new trailer showing off the PlatinumGames-produced action-adventure, also taking the time to spotlight some exclusive new DLC content.

The Switch port, titled NieR: Automata — End of YORHA Edition, will already feature all of the post-release skins, gear, and other additional items featured in its PlayStation, PC, and Xbox brethren, but will also include the all-new “6C2P4A118680823” DLC pack, which will include new character costumes for protagonists 2B, 9S, and A2, as well as new looks for their respective pods. The DLC includes outfits based on the recent remake NieR: Replicant, as well as some traditional Japanese garb, including samurai and kunoichi gear, complete with fox masks.
NieR: Automata first launched on PS4 back in 2017 and has slowly gathered a larger and larger audience in the ensuing years. The dizzying hack ‘n’ slash title tells the story of a war between mankind and the machines, and the fates of the sentient androids that are placed right in the center of the interplanetary conflict. NieR: Automata has won praise for its bleak, dystopian world, dramatic storytelling, smart enemy design, and its unforgettable protagonist, 2B, who has fast become a gaming icon. And with the release The End of YORHA Edition no doubt bring further acolytes are to be brought into the fold.
NieR: Automata — End of YORHA Edition launches October 6 on Nintendo Switch.

<h2>Why couldn’t this have been <em>Twisted Metal III</em>?</h2>
<p>2012 was a pretty bad year. Your crazy co-worker was right, and the world was laid waste to by Mayans or something. Corporations were quick to rise from the ashes to monetize our misery. Big Daddy, for example, rebuilt the United States into a massive tourist attraction. Relive the days before the catastrophe in luxury and see the sights!</p>
<p>But the gig economy won’t be kept down. Automercenaries compete to the death to show vacationers around the exploited remains of the country. Have you considered putting your life on the line to shuttle the bored middle-class around the newly veneered monuments of this dystopian hellscape?</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen_RogueTrip01.jpeg?resize=640%2C531"" alt=""Rogue Trip Washington DC"" /></p>
<p>That’s my embellished take on the plot of <i>Rogue Trip: Vacation 2012</i>, though it’s rather accurate. It’s a vehicular combat game that actually involves giving tours.</p>
<p><i>Rogue Trip</i> was developed by Singletrac after their contract with Sony expired and they were left without any <i>Twisted Metals</i> to work on. Instead, they took it upon themselves to further embarrass 989 Studios’ <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/if-you-were-hoping-for-twisted-metal-iii-to-be-mediocre-your-wish-is-granted/"" target=""_blank""><i>Twisted Metal III</i></a> the same year as <i>Vigilante 8</i>. It has pedigree, with many of the developers from <i>Twisted Metal</i> and its sequel working on it. No, not David Jaffe.</p>
<p>All the same, you can easily see <i>Twisted Metal</i> in <i>Rogue Trip</i>, they just added an extra twist to it. If you went from <i>Twisted Metal 2</i> to <i>Rogue Trip</i>, you’d probably feel right at home. The weapons all seem familiar, the controls are practically the same, and you know those directional pad combos that activate things like shields? Yeah, those are still here. And they still suck.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen_RogueTrip02.jpeg?resize=640%2C530"" alt=""Rogue Trip Showing Elvis the sights"" /></p>
<p>The edge has been taken off. Sort of. Remember how the first two <i>Twisted Metal </i>games had an unsettling quality to them? <i>Rogue Trip</i> is a lot goofier. One of the characters is a chef that drives a hot dog. Another is a cross between Batman and Mickey Mouse. A swarm of angry poodles is one woman’s special attack. It’s not all flowers and good times, but it’s a heck of a lot brighter than Singletrac’s previous games.</p>
<p>The other big change is in the economy. The tourists are there as a sort of a take on capture the flag. You need to grab them, take them to the various sights around the arena, and rack up some cash. If another driver gets hold of them before you do, you either destroy them or use a weapon to eject the tourist and grab them before someone else.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, however, the name of the game is still to be the last one standing. It’s not a complete reinvention of the genre. The money can just be used to repair your vehicle and upgrade your weapons. If you want to just go ham on your opponents and throw whatever you can grab, I’m not sure that’s the soundest strategy, but have at it.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen_RogueTrip03.jpeg?resize=640%2C531"" alt=""Rogue Trip San Francisco"" /></p>
<p>You travel from Washington D.C. to Las Vegas. Grotesque versions of them, anyhow. Big Daddy generally features heavily in the scenery. It’s his America, after all. This game suddenly feels quite topical.</p>
<p>The levels are, thankfully, more of <i>Twisted Metal 2</i> quality than <i>Twisted Metal III’s</i> dismal offerings. They provide the same sort of opportunities for destruction, though I don’t remember seeing anything as awe-inspiring as blowing up the Eiffel Tower. Still, the very fact that you need to show a tourist around ensures that there are interesting things to fill your eyeballs up with.</p>
<p>One deficiency it has against the <i>Twisted Metal </i>games is arguably its cast of characters. <i>Twisted Metal</i> seemed to have something for everyone — bizarre, creepy, heroic, villainous, cool, stupid — <i>Rogue Trip</i> is mostly just bizarre and stupid. A flamboyant wrestler, a sexy nun, a grotesque Elvis. You’ll probably pick the guy who drives the weiner-mobile, because when all you have is weird to pick from, you might as well go for the weiner.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen_RogueTrip04.jpeg?resize=640%2C531"" alt=""Rogue Trip Daddywood"" /></p>
<p><i>Rogue Trip</i> doesn’t really do anything new for the genre, which is probably why it got buried by <i>Vigilante 8</i>. The tourists don’t really add all that much. You don’t want to completely discard that little divet of gameplay, but I never really used the weapon upgrade system. I usually just kept my cash for repairing my vehicle.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is going to divide people because it heavily features ska. The Mighty Might Bosstones are pretty prominent, to give you an idea of what you’re looking at. I personally don’t mind ska, but I know some people look at it as sewage flung from a trumpet, so I feel I should at least offer a warning. You could always crank down the music and listen to, I don’t know, Rob Zombie.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen_RogueTrip05.jpeg?resize=640%2C532"" alt=""Beach"" /></p>
<p>In a perfect world, <i>Twisted Metal III</i> would have been shunned completely and a pedestal would be erected for <i>Rogue Trip. </i>It’s not perfect, but in the absence of an actual good <i>Twisted Metal </i>title in 1998, it deserved the attention. That’s just the power of the brand, I guess. This was the height of the vehicular combat genre, and while <i>Rogue Trip</i> wasn’t the apex, it definitely belongs at the cool kids’ table.</p>
<p>It’s really worth playing if you enjoy the ‘90s era of vehicular combat games. I say that as if there’s a modern era. Hold on, I’m going to try and think of the most recent game released in this particular sub-genre. Uh, <i>Carmageddon Max Damage</i>. Does that count? How about <i>Gas Guzzlers: Extreme</i>?

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

<p>Nintendo is known for kicking off their Nintendo Directs with style, and announcing <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/fire-emblem-engage-divine-edition-switch/""><em>Fire Emblem Engage</em></a> is no exception.</p>
<p>Shown off with a brand new very detailed accompanying trailer, we get a sense of the dragon-based conflict within this game world, as well as some gameplay to boot. Here’s the full description of what to expect:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In a war against the Fell Dragon, four kingdoms worked together with heroes from other worlds to seal away this great evil. One thousand years later, this seal has weakened and the Fell Dragon is about to reawaken. As a Divine Dragon, use rich strategies and robust customization to meet your destiny – to collect Emblem Rings scattered across the world and bring peace back to the Continent of Elyos. Summon and fight alongside legendary heroes from past <em>Fire Emblem</em> games, like Marth and Celica, and add their power to yours in this new story. The turn-based, tactical battle system the <em>Fire Emblem</em> series is known for returns with a fresh cast of characters you can customize and Engage with to carefully craft your strategy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Ha! That bit about summoning prior heroes is such a great way to pack in some nostalgia, and sell the game in a variety of ways with all sorts of key art from classic characters. <strong>It’s out on January 20, 2023</strong>.

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

		<h2>Rumble Roses</h2>
<p>Something<em> very</em> special from the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster takes time out from its recent Namco obsession to deliver not only a Tecmo title, but a fun, silly, and particularly obscure one at that — Available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch its forgotten fighter <em>Angel Eyes!</em></p>
<p>Released to Japanese arcades in 1996, <em>Angel Eyes</em> — or to give it its full title<em> Tōkidenshō Angel Eyes</em> — is a super cult 2D fighter that was renowned for sporting an All Anime Gal cast of scrappers. A selection of fun character tropes, including a school girl, a volleyball player, a kunoichi, an arrogant “ojou” woman, and a young girl with a giant teddy bear (<a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dnf-duel-enchantress-trailer-nexon-fighting-games-arcsys/"" target=""_blank"">predating Enchantress by several decades</a>), fight it out in cute ‘n’ colorful action, set against the backdrop of some equally strange locations, such as a fun fair, and a medieval castle!</p>
<p>Check out the cute ‘n’ crazy carnage in the video below, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR2L0bPxY_M"" target=""_blank"">courtesy of YouTuber Colmarr.</a></p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/hR2L0bPxY_M?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Angel Eyes</em>, despite its seeming irrelevance, had some surprisingly prescient ideas. Not only is it one of the first-ever “all women” fighting games, but it is also one of the first 2D fighters to feature a heavy slant on juggles and air combos. Perhaps its funniest and most bizarre mechanic, however, is reserved for the so-called “reverse combo correction” system, which actually<em> increases</em> damage the longer a combo goes on — rather than scales it back. And thus, players with one or two fairly solid combos can find themselves taking down their opponents in a manner of seconds.</p>
<p>You thought <em>Street Fighter V</em> was “three mistakes to death”? Try “one mistake to death”!</p>
<p>Despite its simplistic nature and dopey mechanics, Angel Eyes is, understandably, not without its charm. Though it would receive a JPN PlayStation point in 1997, the series would quietly disappear into the annals of fighting game history. Still, it’s lovely to see it again. And, as opposed to a lot of the Arcade Archives releases, <em>Angel Eyes</em> is a title that actually requires archiving, due to its obscure, rare nature.</p>
<p><em>Angel Eyes</em> is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.</p>

<h2>“<span>Survival horror reimagined</span>“</h2>
<p>Sony kicked off this afternoon’s State of Play showcase in one of the best ways possible: with a new <em>Resident Evil</em> announcement! We got our first official look at the <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/resident-evil-4-remake-scarier-tone-report-capcom-news/"" target=""_blank"">long-rumored</a> <em>Resident Evil 4</em> remake, along with a March 24, 2023 release date and confirmation that PlayStation VR2 “content” is currently “in development.” What a way to start!</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-L1EuRo54pI?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>The first footage of this RE Engine <em>Resident Evil 4</em> remake looks familiar in some spots and foreign in others. Overall, at least with this specific trailer, it seems like the vibe is more horror-centric. How Capcom will handle some of <em>Resident Evil 4</em>‘s wackier moments remains to be seen and will surely be cause for a lot of speculation, especially after the <em>Resident Evil 3</em> remake felt trimmed down. I hope it strikes the right balance of new vs. old.</p>
<p>I mean, many of us have lost count of how many times we’ve torn through <em>RE4</em> in its many, <em>many</em> ported forms. I’m excited to see something fresh, that hits hard in 2023, without straying too far from what made the original game great. It’ll be a steep challenge.</p>
<p>According to Capcom, “many team members from the production of 2019’s [<em>Resident Evil 2</em> remake] also make their return.”</p>

<h2>A “familiar” vs. “fresh” balancing act</h2>
<p><a href=""https://blog.playstation.com/2022/06/02/resident-evil-4-comes-to-ps5-next-year-first-gameplay-and-story-details/"" target=""_blank"">On the PlayStation Blog</a>, promotion producer Edvin Edsö said that the developers at Capcom “aim to make [the <em>Resident Evil 4</em> remake] feel familiar to fans of the series, while also providing a fresh feeling to it. This is being done by reimagining the storyline of the game while keeping the essence of its direction, modernizing the graphics, and updating the controls to a modern standard.”</p>
<p>PlayStation VR2 content for <em>Resident Evil 4</em> is fantastic to hear, as <em>Resident Evil 7</em> did a lot of heavy lifting for Sony’s original VR headset. And as a bonus, the State of Play stream also confirmed that <em>Resident Evil Village</em> will support PlayStation VR2. My wish came true!</p>
<p>Capcom shared more details about <em>Resident Evil Village</em>‘s VR support in <a href=""https://blog.playstation.com/2022/06/02/resident-evil-village-is-coming-to-psvr2/"" target=""_blank"">a PlayStation Blog article</a>, noting: “you’ll use the PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers to represent each hand in-world. Try guarding using both of your arms and Ethan will guard in the same way; hold up a gun and Ethan will hold up his. You are also now able to execute dynamic actions such as <strong>firing your gun while holding a knife with the other hand</strong>, or holding a handgun with one hand and a shotgun with the other. These advanced controllers increase the player’s immersion with the game.”</p>
<p>“Release date and pricing” info hasn’t been divulged yet.</p>

<p>Following the State of Play stream, Capcom <a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1532487904810831872"" target=""_blank"">confirmed</a> that <em>Resident Evil 4</em> will launch on Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 24, 2023 — it’s not cross-gen!</p>

“Survival horror reimagined“
Sony kicked off this afternoon’s State of Play showcase in one of the best ways possible: with a new Resident Evil announcement! We got our first official look at the long-rumored Resident Evil 4 remake, along with a March 24, 2023 release date and confirmation that PlayStation VR2 “content” is currently “in development.” What a way to start!

The first footage of this RE Engine Resident Evil 4 remake looks familiar in some spots and foreign in others. Overall, at least with this specific trailer, it seems like the vibe is more horror-centric. How Capcom will handle some of Resident Evil 4‘s wackier moments remains to be seen and will surely be cause for a lot of speculation, especially after the Resident Evil 3 remake felt trimmed down. I hope it strikes the right balance of new vs. old.
I mean, many of us have lost count of how many times we’ve torn through RE4 in its many, many ported forms. I’m excited to see something fresh, that hits hard in 2023, without straying too far from what made the original game great. It’ll be a steep challenge.
According to Capcom, “many team members from the production of 2019’s [Resident Evil 2 remake] also make their return.”

A “familiar” vs. “fresh” balancing act
On the PlayStation Blog, promotion producer Edvin Edsö said that the developers at Capcom “aim to make [the Resident Evil 4 remake] feel familiar to fans of the series, while also providing a fresh feeling to it. This is being done by reimagining the storyline of the game while keeping the essence of its direction, modernizing the graphics, and updating the controls to a modern standard.”
PlayStation VR2 content for Resident Evil 4 is fantastic to hear, as Resident Evil 7 did a lot of heavy lifting for Sony’s original VR headset. And as a bonus, the State of Play stream also confirmed that Resident Evil Village will support PlayStation VR2. My wish came true!
Capcom shared more details about Resident Evil Village‘s VR support in a PlayStation Blog article, noting: “you’ll use the PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers to represent each hand in-world. Try guarding using both of your arms and Ethan will guard in the same way; hold up a gun and Ethan will hold up his. You are also now able to execute dynamic actions such as firing your gun while holding a knife with the other hand, or holding a handgun with one hand and a shotgun with the other. These advanced controllers increase the player’s immersion with the game.”
“Release date and pricing” info hasn’t been divulged yet.

Following the State of Play stream, Capcom confirmed that Resident Evil 4 will launch on Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 24, 2023 — it’s not cross-gen!
Here are some early RE4 (2023) screenshots, including two of the iconic village:

<h2>New hero filled some mighty large snakeskin shoes</h2>
<p>Back when Destructoid nominated its<a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/2020-may-have-been-a-crap-year-but-it-gave-us-some-amazing-new-characters-612539.phtml"" target=""_blank""> favorite new characters of 2020</a>, I talked about<em> <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/stories/review-yakuza-like-a-dragon-608900.phtml"" target=""_blank"">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a></em>‘s hapless hero, Ichiban Kasuga. Nobody but nobody, it would’ve seemed, could successfully fill the role of long-term <em>Yakuza</em> protagonist Kazuma Kiryu — one of the coolest, likable, and most beloved protagonists in Sega’s, nay, in <em>gaming</em> history.</p>
<p>But, somehow, new boy Kasuga hit the ground running, masterfully blending stoicism, bravery, pathos, heroism, and just the right amount of complete and utter idiocy to immediately win the hearts of the<em> Yakuza</em> faithful. The boy came good, and despite having only been around for a single release, it already feels like Kasuga has been around for the franchise’s full 15 years.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.theverge.com/22321087/yakuza-like-a-dragon-story-interview-masayoshi-yokoyama"" target=""_blank"">Speaking in a (<strong>spoilery</strong>) interview with The Verge</a>, Team Yakuza writer and designer Masayoshi Yokoyama reflected on the impact created by the burgundy-suited maniac. Yokoyama noted that, having spent the past 18 years in prison, Kasuga has a whole life to catch up on, with more than enough time to get tangled up in a hell of a lot of dramatic and catastrophic shenanigans as he readjusts to the outside world.</p>
<p>“I think that <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em> is only the first chapter of Ichiban Kasuga’s life,” mused Yokoyama on his character’s future. “Since he was in prison for 18 years, he has only just begun his life as an adult man. I’m sure there’s probably many trials and tribulations that await him.”</p>
<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/hkygiqC7ulQ"" width=""560"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>Now, that isn’t to say that fans are <em>guaranteed</em> a string on Kasuga-led <em>Yakuza</em> releases, even if his predecessor, Kazuma, saw the best part of seven series entries. Yokoyama hints that nothing about <em>Yakuza</em>‘s narrative future is written in stone, stopping short of confirming whether Kasuga will carry the <em>Yakuza</em> franchise forward into the new generation of gaming.</p>
<p>“As Kasuga starts out his new life, he will surely encounter challenges that he cannot solve through violence or brute force. I develop each game with the intention of creating a life of a single person. I’m not sure if I’ll continue to write Ichiban Kasuga’s life or not, but I can totally imagine him in deep trouble somewhere on the face of this Earth [laughs].”</p>
<p>Following on from <em>Yakuza 6: The Song of Life</em>, Sega and Team Yakuza took multiple chances with <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>. The title features a huge cast of new characters, several new locales, a new lead and, most controversially of all, a completely redesigned combat system. For the most part, all of these changes found favor with the Yakuza community at large, as the franchise continues to reach across the pond to western audiences – boosted by marketing which leans on <em>Like a Dragon</em> ridiculous humor.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it would be very surprising if Ichiban Kasuga does not become our boy going forward. The wild-haired hero stepped into a hallowed role, in a title filled with experimental new ideas and mechanics, and won over the audience in his very first appearance. Personally, I’d be more than happy to see Team Yakuza hand Kasuga the baseball bat and entrust the affable hero to knock it out of the cage time and again.</p>
<p>It was a risk, but it paid off. And as the man once said: “All’s well that ends well.”</p>

<p>Something<em> very</em> special from the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster takes time out from its recent Namco obsession to deliver not only a Tecmo title, but a fun, silly, and particularly obscure one at that — Available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch its forgotten fighter <em>Angel Eyes!</em></p>
<p>Released to Japanese arcades in 1996, <em>Angel Eyes</em> — or to give it its full title<em> Tōkidenshō Angel Eyes</em> — is a super cult 2D fighter that was renowned for sporting an All Anime Gal cast of scrappers. A selection of fun character tropes, including a school girl, a volleyball player, a kunoichi, an arrogant “ojou” woman, and a young girl with a giant teddy bear (<a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dnf-duel-enchantress-trailer-nexon-fighting-games-arcsys/"" target=""_blank"">predating Enchantress by several decades</a>), fight it out in cute ‘n’ colorful action, set against the backdrop of some equally strange locations, such as a fun fair, and a medieval castle!</p>
<p>Check out the cute ‘n’ crazy carnage in the video below, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR2L0bPxY_M"" target=""_blank"">courtesy of YouTuber Colmarr.</a></p>

<p><em>Angel Eyes</em>, despite its seeming irrelevance, had some surprisingly prescient ideas. Not only is it one of the first-ever “all women” fighting games, but it is also one of the first 2D fighters to feature a heavy slant on juggles and air combos. Perhaps its funniest and most bizarre mechanic, however, is reserved for the so-called “reverse combo correction” system, which actually<em> increases</em> damage the longer a combo goes on — rather than scales it back. And thus, players with one or two fairly solid combos can find themselves taking down their opponents in a manner of seconds.</p>
<p>You thought <em>Street Fighter V</em> was “three mistakes to death”? Try “one mistake to death”!</p>
<p>Despite its simplistic nature and dopey mechanics, Angel Eyes is, understandably, not without its charm. Though it would receive a JPN PlayStation point in 1997, the series would quietly disappear into the annals of fighting game history. Still, it’s lovely to see it again. And, as opposed to a lot of the Arcade Archives releases, <em>Angel Eyes</em> is a title that actually requires archiving, due to its obscure, rare nature.</p>
<p><em>Angel Eyes</em> is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.</p>

<h2>Mike Ybarra will be taking over sole leadership of Blizzard</h2>
<p>One of Blizzard’s leaders has announced they’re stepping away from the company. Today, Jen Oneal announced she’ll be leaving the company at the end of the year, with her co-leader Mike Ybarra taking over Oneal’s responsibilities.</p>
<p>Oneal and Ybarra were announced as the new co-leaders of Blizzard Entertainment following the departure of <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/j-allen-brack-is-leaving-blizzard-entertainment-activision/"" target=""_blank"">J. Allen Brack</a>, which came after the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-toxic-workplace-allegations-california/"" target=""_blank"">sued Activision Blizzard over reports of discrimination and a toxic workplace culture</a>.</p>
<p>Oneal’s career ran back over 20 years across Activision, Vicarious Visions, and then Blizzard. According to an <a href=""https://activisionblizzard.com/newsroom/2021/10/leadership-change-and-a-new-commitment"" target=""_blank"">Activision Blizzard statement</a>, she will be taking time to find new opportunities that bring her two passions closer together: game development and diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>
<p>“I am doing this not because I am without hope for Blizzard, quite the opposite—I’m inspired by the passion of everyone here, working towards meaningful, lasting change with their whole hearts,” Oneal wrote in a goodbye letter (via <a href=""https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/02/jen-oneal-leaves-blizzard-co-leader-role-mike-ybarra-becomes-sole-boss/"" target=""_blank"">GamesBeat</a>). “This energy has inspired me to step out and explore how I can do more to have games and diversity intersect, and hopefully make a broader industry impact that will benefit Blizzard (and other studios) as well. While I am not totally sure what form that will take, I am excited to embark on a new journey to find out.”</p>

<p>Activision Blizzard has also said it will be making a $1 million grant to Women in Games International in her honor. Oneal will leave at the end of the year, spending her remaining time transitioning into a new role building up programs that could be funded by the grant. Ybarra, meanwhile, will assume Oneal’s current responsibilities at Blizzard.</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard recently outlined changes coming to the company in response to the investigations, including an <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/activision-blizzard-ceo-pay-cut-required-arbitration-news/"" target=""_blank"">end to required arbitration</a>. The ABK Workers Alliance characterized it as a “<a href=""https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1453764023753887745"" target=""_blank"">huge win</a>,” but also said there’s more to be done. Employees had previously signed letters and <a href=""https://www.upcomer.com/activision-blizzard-employees-walkout-demand-change-after-lawsuit/"" target=""_blank"">organized a walkout</a>, calling for change at the company.</p>
<p>As part of today’s Activision Blizzard earnings update, the company also confirmed that <em>Diablo IV </em>and <em>Overwatch 2 </em>would be <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/blizzard-announces-diablo-iv-overwatch-2-delay/"" target=""_blank"">coming later than expected</a>.

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

Mike Ybarra will be taking over sole leadership of Blizzard
One of Blizzard’s leaders has announced they’re stepping away from the company. Today, Jen Oneal announced she’ll be leaving the company at the end of the year, with her co-leader Mike Ybarra taking over Oneal’s responsibilities.
Oneal and Ybarra were announced as the new co-leaders of Blizzard Entertainment following the departure of J. Allen Brack, which came after the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing sued Activision Blizzard over reports of discrimination and a toxic workplace culture.
Oneal’s career ran back over 20 years across Activision, Vicarious Visions, and then Blizzard. According to an Activision Blizzard statement, she will be taking time to find new opportunities that bring her two passions closer together: game development and diversity, equity, and inclusion.
“I am doing this not because I am without hope for Blizzard, quite the opposite—I’m inspired by the passion of everyone here, working towards meaningful, lasting change with their whole hearts,” Oneal wrote in a goodbye letter (via GamesBeat). “This energy has inspired me to step out and explore how I can do more to have games and diversity intersect, and hopefully make a broader industry impact that will benefit Blizzard (and other studios) as well. While I am not totally sure what form that will take, I am excited to embark on a new journey to find out.”

Oneal will leave at the end of the year, spending her remaining time transitioning into a new role building up programs that could be funded by the grant. Ybarra, meanwhile, will assume Oneal’s current responsibilities at Blizzard.

The ABK Workers Alliance characterized it as a “huge win,” but also said there’s more to be done. Employees had previously signed letters and organized a walkout, calling for change at the company.
As part of today’s Activision Blizzard earnings update, the company also confirmed that Diablo IV and Overwatch 2 would be coming later than expected. This follows after both the Diablo and Overwatch teams saw turnover at the top.


 


						
	
		Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs
Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.
The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.

In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.
The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.

For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.

<h2>Plan your moves out in advance</h2>
<p>The release of <em>Triangle Strategy </em>is right around the corner, but you can test the waters a bit early starting today. A new demo for <em>Triangle Strategy </em>is out today on the Nintendo Switch, with progress carrying over into the main game.</p>
<p>The Prologue Demo, available now, will let you transfer your save data to the full game once purchased. It’s a similar structure to <em><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/octopath-traveler-has-a-new-demo-on-the-eshop/"" target=""_blank"">Octopath Traveler</a> </em>and other demos in the past, and hey, it’s still pretty neat. The demo covers the first three chapters of <em>Triangle Strategy </em>too, so it seems like a pretty good chunk to try out.</p>

<p>Though the last <em>Triangle Strategy </em>demo covered only a small slice of the game, it also <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/square-enix-triangle-strategy-demo-changes-feedback-news/"" target=""_blank"">resulted in a lot of feedback</a> that Square Enix worked on afterwards. Today’s Prologue demo should be a good chance to see if the changes made address all the concerns, and how the whole strategy will come together ahead of launch.</p>
<p><em>Triangle Strategy </em>is Square Enix’s take on the tactics genre, with a look and feel akin to how <em>Octopath Traveler </em>tackled classic RPGs. Team Asano looks to be applying much of the same here, applying a pretty good looking HD-2D look and branching choices to the framework of classic strategy RPGs.</p>
<p>This was <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-most-anticipated-video-games-of-2022-list/"" target=""_blank"">my personal choice</a> for most anticipated game of this year, so yes, I’m very eager to finish writing this news post up so I can go play the demo myself. And with a few weeks left until <em>Triangle Strategy </em>launches on March 4, we’ve at least got some time to mess around with the systems and battles before the full game’s here.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

		<h2>Rumble Roses</h2>
<p>Something<em> very</em> special from the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster takes time out from its recent Namco obsession to deliver not only a Tecmo title, but a fun, silly, and particularly obscure one at that — Available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch its forgotten fighter <em>Angel Eyes!</em></p>
<p>Released to Japanese arcades in 1996, <em>Angel Eyes</em> — or to give it its full title<em> Tōkidenshō Angel Eyes</em> — is a super cult 2D fighter that was renowned for sporting an All Anime Gal cast of scrappers. A selection of fun character tropes, including a school girl, a volleyball player, a kunoichi, an arrogant “ojou” woman, and a young girl with a giant teddy bear (<a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dnf-duel-enchantress-trailer-nexon-fighting-games-arcsys/"" target=""_blank"">predating Enchantress by several decades</a>), fight it out in cute ‘n’ colorful action, set against the backdrop of some equally strange locations, such as a fun fair, and a medieval castle!</p>
<p>Check out the cute ‘n’ crazy carnage in the video below, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR2L0bPxY_M"" target=""_blank"">courtesy of YouTuber Colmarr.</a></p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/hR2L0bPxY_M?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Angel Eyes</em>, despite its seeming irrelevance, had some surprisingly prescient ideas. Not only is it one of the first-ever “all women” fighting games, but it is also one of the first 2D fighters to feature a heavy slant on juggles and air combos. Perhaps its funniest and most bizarre mechanic, however, is reserved for the so-called “reverse combo correction” system, which actually<em> increases</em> damage the longer a combo goes on — rather than scales it back. And thus, players with one or two fairly solid combos can find themselves taking down their opponents in a manner of seconds.</p>
<p>You thought <em>Street Fighter V</em> was “three mistakes to death”? Try “one mistake to death”!</p>
<p>Despite its simplistic nature and dopey mechanics, Angel Eyes is, understandably, not without its charm. Though it would receive a JPN PlayStation point in 1997, the series would quietly disappear into the annals of fighting game history. Still, it’s lovely to see it again. And, as opposed to a lot of the Arcade Archives releases, <em>Angel Eyes</em> is a title that actually requires archiving, due to its obscure, rare nature.</p>
<p><em>Angel Eyes</em> is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.</p>

<p>Well, it’s happening! Sorta! It’s not the full Nintendo Direct that was predicted by some on June 29 — rather, it’s a Nintendo Direct Mini on June 28.

<p><strong>Again, it’s important to note that this isn’t a first-party Direct, and to set your expectations accordingly</strong>. Here is the full descriptive rundown of the Nintendo Direct Mini that we got directly from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Watch on-demand via our YouTube channel starting at 6 a.m. PT / 9 a.m. ET on June 28 for roughly 25 minutes of info on upcoming third-party Nintendo Switch games.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So on paper, we’re not getting updates on <em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2</em> or <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>…yet. Or an update on when <em>Advance Wars</em> might come out on Switch for that matter.</p>
<p>25 minutes is a fairly meaty timeframe, in any case, so we should see at least one big third-party announcement. I assume a lot of you will be doing avid amounts of research as to what a Nintendo Direct Mini actually entails, and we did a lot of the legwork already! <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/heres-a-recap-of-todays-surprise-october-nintendo-direct-mini/"">You can check this out to get an idea of what a Direct Mini could look like</a>.</p>
<p>The company was smart to move this away from the Summer of Gaming/to-E3-or-not-to-E3 week and have it be its own thing. Even if it doesn’t include first-party updates, all it takes is one megaton announcement (something exclusive akin to <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>) to make waves.</p>

<p>Today’s showcase trailer formally introduced the sinister-looking AI, Leviathan, who will oversee research — yes… “research” — involving exosuit-wearing warriors tasked with culling relentless prehistoric beasts and mutated monstrosities.

It’s all sort of chaotic, with dinos swarming a careening airplane, swirling around a tornado, and spilling out of vortexes.</p>
<p>Depending on Leviathan’s whims, <em>Exoprimal</em> players will need to slay certain dinosaurs, charge up an Omega Hammer and use it to destroy targets, directly go after the opposing crew, escort a Data Key, defend a position, or battle a Neo T. Rex, among other goals.</p>
<p>According to Capcom, there are story sequences — and XP-based rewards — to unlock through Dino Survival matches. I’m curious to hear more about how the progression flows, but for now, as a bug-exterminating <em>Earth Defense Force</em> fan who’s into this sort of team-based race-to-be-first premise, I want to try that test build. I like some oddball action.</p>
<p><em>Exoprimal</em> is still targeting a 2023 release on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

Here’s a new look at the dinosaur-culling team objectives and your antagonistic AI overlord
During today’s Capcom Showcase, we got another check-in with Exoprimal, a PvPvE team action game about keeping the dinosaur hordes at bay, one crisis at a time. Some of us are open enough to this concept to want to at least give it a chance, and on that front, Capcom is hosting a closed network test for Exoprimal‘s main mode, Dino Survival, on Steam.
Registration for the Exoprimal network test will open later today. According to Capcom, the team will take entries until June 29 at 4:59 p.m. Pacific. You can see a full breakdown of the network test on the website, but here are the play times:

<h2>And what will be left of them?</h2>
<p>Supermassive Games is gearing up for the launch of <em><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/the-dark-pictures-anthology-the-devil-in-me-favorite-premise-yet/"" target=""_blank"">The Devil in Me</a>,</em> the fourth and final episode in the first season of its scary, (and highly enjoyable) anthology series, <em>The Dark Pictures.</em> Publisher Bandai Namco <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUcFLkAZmyo"" target=""_blank"">released a new trailer</a>, focusing on the hapless folk treading, foolhardily, into The Curator’s world.</p>
<p><em>The Dark Pictures: The Devil in Me</em> will tell a tale of a party of documentary makers who find themselves invited to a modern replica of the “The Murder Castle” — the opulent estate of America’s first publicized serial killer H. H. Holmes. Seeing this as the opportunity to make the ultimate true crime document, our young protagonists jump at the opportunity, unaware of the horrifying, twisted plans that lay in store…</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/VUcFLkAZmyo?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailer introduces heroes Charlie, Kate, Mark, Jamie, and Erin, with quick glimpses offered of a mysterious, cloaked killer and, of course, The Curator himself. Of all <em>The Dark Pictures</em> titles to date, The Devil in Me looks set to be the most “slasher” based, perhaps eschewing <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-dark-pictures-man-of-medan/"" target=""_blank"">the supernatural</a> and/or <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-dark-pictures-anthology-house-of-ashes/"" target=""_blank"">monster-based terror</a> of its predecessors. Horror fans will also spot numerous familiar themes and references, from a <em>Shining</em>-esque bar and a <em>Tourist Trap</em> range of animatronics, to <em>Saw</em>-style “death traps” and the Giallo overtones of the villain themselves.</p>
<p>The Devil in Me will represent the culmination of <em>The Dark Pictures</em>‘ first season, which has bombarded us with a frenzied party of pain and jump-scares over the past four years. Still, with a whole host of <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/supermassive-games-trademarks-multiple-new-dark-pictures-titles/"" target=""_blank"">previously trademarked titles</a>, and sales still riding relatively high, we can be sure that there are many more thrills and spills currently in the works within the gleefully grotesque minds of Supermassive Games.</p>
<p><em>The Dark Pictures: The Devil in Me</em> launches November 18 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.</p>

		<h2>A new interface is coming to the PC-TV setup</h2>
<p>Valve is planning to update its Big Picture viewing mode with the new interface it designed for the Steam Deck. The Steam manufacturer has the new user interface on the beta right now.</p>
<p>This update was announced <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/steam-big-picture-mode-steam-deck-ui/"" target=""_blank"">a while ago</a>, but it looks like it could be rolling out soon. Already, the feature is available in the Steam client through its beta options.</p>
<p>As detailed in a <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3394051164709183117"" target=""_blank"">news post</a>, you just need to opt into the Steam Client beta. Then, head over to the properties and add the “-gamepadui” launch parameter. There’s also a <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigpicture/discussions/?snr=2_groupannouncements_detail_"" target=""_blank"">forum open</a> for feedback.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/AvokyBOYe8Y?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>Big Picture is Valve’s <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/a-quick-look-at-steams-big-picture/"" target=""_blank"">special set-up</a> for users who want a Steam UI that’s more conducive to a TV set-up. And since that often entails a gamepad in hand, the Steam Deck UI does seem like a good fit.</p>
<p>The updated Big Picture mode now includes a new Home Screen, a Universal Search, and optimized Steam Store for controller navigation.</p>
<p>A new configurator should make it easier for adjusting and creating custom controller configurations. And updated game overlay, system menu, and quick access menu should hopefully make jaunting around Steam’s interfaces easier.</p>
<h2>A new lens</h2>
<p>I’ve been spending more and more time using my Steam Deck, and have also used the old Steam Big Picture UI a fair bit, and have to say: this all feels like a good upgrade.</p>
<p>The user interface certainly isn’t the sole reason that Steam Decks are <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/steam-deck-readily-available-for-purchase-valve-pc-hardware/"" target=""_blank"">becoming pretty darn popular</a>, but the general experience on them is solid. I’ve had little trouble navigating its menus or finding what I need to.</p>
<p>So for those who play PC on the TV or still have a <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/valve-discontinues-the-steam-link-hardware/"" target=""_blank"">Steam Link</a> stashed away somewhere, this is nice to see. The beta is currently live to opt into and test out for yourself.</p>

<h2>Pump the Brakes</h2>
<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic=""true"">Electronic Arts, in an internal statement <a href=""https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-dropping-project-cars"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">acquired by GamesIndustry.biz</a>, has announced that it is ending the <em>Project CARS</em> racing franchise, effective immediately. This makes the final release in the simulation series the mobile title <em>Project CARS GO</em>, which launched on iOS and Android in 2021.</p>


<p>“Today we announced internally an update to our racing portfolio. Following an evaluation of the next <em>Project CARS</em> title and its longer-term growth potential, we have made the decision to stop further development and investment for the franchise,” reads the statement. “Decisions like these are very hard, but allow us to prioritise our focus in areas where we believe we have the strongest opportunity to create experiences that fans will love.”</p>
<p>“We are working with everyone impacted by this decision to place them into suitable roles across our EA Sports and racing portfolio, as well as other parts of EA, wherever we can. Our priority now is on providing as much support as possible to our people through this transition.”</p>
<p><iframe loading=""lazy"" title=""Project CARS 3 - Reveal Trailer - PS4 / Xbox1 / PC"" width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/8BPzkjvV_Rk?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen="""" data-gtm-yt-inspected-12=""true"" id=""241059181""></iframe></p>
<p>The <em>Project CARS</em> IP became the property of EA following the <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/ea-swoops-in-to-acquire-codemasters-overtaking-recent-bid-by-take-two-interactive/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">purchase of Codemasters</a> and its subsidiaries, (including <em>CARS</em> developer Slightly Mad Studios), in December 2020. At the time of purchase, Slightly Mad had somewhere in the region of 150 employees, and so here’s to hoping that EA will ensure new roles for the studio’s staff throughout its myriad other development and publishing wings.</p>
<p>There have been four<em> Project CARS</em> games in total, including<em> Project CARS GO</em>. Though the first two games received critical and fan acclaim, <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/project-cars-3-hits-the-gas-august-28-on-ps4-pc-and-xbox-one/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><em>Project CARS 3</em></a> was less warmly received. Earlier this year, it was announced that the first two titles were to be delisted from sale due to the expiration of in-game licenses, and it would seem that EA has decided that this particular racer has run its course.</p>

		<h2>DO NOT IGNORE</h2>
<p>It’s hardly the world’s best-kept secret that Electronic Arts is working on a new title for its long-running racing franchise, Need for Speed, but the publisher is yet to officially reveal the road-ripper in question — That looks all set to change very soon, as EA is now teasing an unveiling for later this week.</p>
<blockquote data-width=""550"" data-dnt=""true"">
<p lang=""und"" dir=""ltr""><img draggable=""false"" role=""img"" alt=""👀"" src=""https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f440.svg""></p>
<p>— Need for Speed (@NeedforSpeed) <a href=""https://twitter.com/NeedforSpeed/status/1576977802750234625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">October 3, 2022</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The official <em>Need for Speed</em> Twitter account <a href=""https://twitter.com/NeedforSpeed"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">has been updated</a> with a spanking new “<em>NFS</em>” avatar and header image, which is amusingly splattered with the order “DO NOT IGNORE”. Asked by a fan whether this meant the premiere of the new game was on deck, EA further teased with a shifty eyes emoticon. So let’s take that as a yes.

Pump the Brakes
Electronic Arts, in an internal statement acquired by GamesIndustry.biz, has announced that it is ending the Project CARS racing franchise, effective immediately. This makes the final release in the simulation series the mobile title Project CARS GO, which launched on iOS and Android in 2021.


“Today we announced internally an update to our racing portfolio. Following an evaluation of the next Project CARS title and its longer-term growth potential, we have made the decision to stop further development and investment for the franchise,” reads the statement. “Decisions like these are very hard, but allow us to prioritise our focus in areas where we believe we have the strongest opportunity to create experiences that fans will love.”
“We are working with everyone impacted by this decision to place them into suitable roles across our EA Sports and racing portfolio, as well as other parts of EA, wherever we can. Our priority now is on providing as much support as possible to our people through this transition.”

The Project CARS IP became the property of EA following the purchase of Codemasters and its subsidiaries, (including CARS developer Slightly Mad Studios), in December 2020. At the time of purchase, Slightly Mad had somewhere in the region of 150 employees, and so here’s to hoping that EA will ensure new roles for the studio’s staff throughout its myriad other development and publishing wings.
There have been four Project CARS games in total, including Project CARS GO. Though the first two games received critical and fan acclaim, Project CARS 3 was less warmly received. Earlier this year, it was announced that the first two titles were to be delisted from sale due to the expiration of in-game licenses, and it would seem that EA has decided that this particular racer has run its course.

		DO NOT IGNORE
It’s hardly the world’s best-kept secret that Electronic Arts is working on a new title for its long-running racing franchise, Need for Speed, but the publisher is yet to officially reveal the road-ripper in question — That looks all set to change very soon, as EA is now teasing an unveiling for later this week.


— Need for Speed (@NeedforSpeed) October 3, 2022

The official Need for Speed Twitter account has been updated with a spanking new “NFS” avatar and header image, which is amusingly splattered with the order “DO NOT IGNORE”. Asked by a fan whether this meant the premiere of the new game was on deck, EA further teased with a shifty eyes emoticon. So let’s take that as a yes. The new game is developed by Codemasters and is rumored to be titled Need for Speed Unbound.
This Twitter update arrives mere days after Giant Bomb writer and frequent spoiler Jeff Grubb, speaking on Giant Bomb’s Giant Mess Mornings podcast, suggested that the NFS reveal was set to take place this week. Grubb has been proven to be pretty darn accurate in these matters, so it looks like NFS fans should start revving their engines, and keep their eyes peeled for a new trailer in the very foreseeable future.

<h2>The closed beta kicks off today</h2>
<p>Odyssey Interactive is officially revealing its first title. It’s a fast-paced competitive game that mixes sports, MOBA, and more called <em>Omega Strikers</em>.</p>
<p>The new three-on-three “knockout striker,” as Odyssey describes it, is a free-to-play and cross-platform competitive game. It’s launching a closed beta on PC via Steam today, and will launch on mobile later this year, with a console release aiming for sometime in 2023.</p>
<p>But what is <em>Omega Strikers</em>? The best description might be that it’s like if soccer, <em>League of Legends</em>, and physics-based fighters like <em>Smash Bros.</em> all blended into one new genre.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/i1kEGXtaJsc?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>Each team plays on a top-down arena, with a goal on either side. The idea is to smack the puck, called the core, around and knock them into the enemy’s goal to score points. Victory is achieved when a team hits five points and goes up by two.</p>
<p>Rough play is encouraged though, as characters can not only fight over the core, but also just plain fight. Abilities allow players to knock each other off the arena, creating power play potential in the interim.</p>

<h2>An interesting cross-up</h2>
<p>It’s an interesting combination of different competitive genres, which isn’t too surprising given the team behind it. Odyssey Interactive is a new studio, but its founders are <a href=""https://venturebeat.com/games/odyssey-interactive-raises-6-million-for-mobile-games/"" target=""_blank"">former Riot Games developers</a>, who have worked on <em>League of Legends </em>and <em>Teamfight Tactics</em>. With <em>Omega Strikers</em>, they’re tackling a different kind of game that still has some familiar ideas. Hero characters, fast combat, and designs that pop. Just add a puck and a goal.</p>
<p><em>Omega Strikers </em>will launch with ten Strikers, their individual characters with unique designs and abilities to use in the arena. It plans to add more in future updates, alongside additional arenas, skins, unlockables, and more ways to compete.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/OmegaStrikers_Goal_091622.jpg?resize=640%2C360&amp;ssl=1"" alt /></p>
<p>Crucially, Odyssey also says there will be no loot boxes, consumable power boosts, or paid competitive advantages. All Strikers will be unlockable through regular play, as well as purchasable through the in-game store. <em>Omega Strikers </em>will also be cross-platform for play and cross-progression. So as other platforms start to roll out, players won’t have to rebuild their roster of Strikers.</p>
<p>The closed beta goes live on PC via Steam today, with plans to distribute keys via Twitch drops à la <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/heres-how-youll-get-into-the-valorant-closed-beta-which-kicks-off-today/"" target=""_blank""><em>Valorant</em></a>.

<h2>A closed test is in the works</h2>
<p>The new <em>Freelancer</em> mode for <em>Hitman 3 </em>is getting another delay. Agent 47’s new undertaking is now aiming to launch on January 26, 2023.</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-3-road-to-freelancer/"" target=""_blank"">new blog</a> from IO Interactive details the roadmap ahead for <em>Hitman 3:</em> <em>Freelancer</em>, in a series it’s calling Road to Freelancer. The <em>Hitman </em>developer plans for several updates between now and January 26, including a closed technical test.</p>
<p>On October 6, a new patch and roadmap will arrive for <em>Hitman 3</em>. Another update on October 27 will have details about when the <em>Hitman 3: Freelancer </em>closed technical test will start and how to get access.</p>
<p>Then, in November, IO plans to host the test. More updates will arrive between then and January 26, when the game mode goes live.</p>

<p><em>Freelancer </em>was originally planned for earlier this year, but has faced a few delays along the way. <em>Hitman 3 </em>has still been seeing some content roll out though, with its latest location Ambrose Island <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/hitman-3-ambnrose-island-out-now-update-location-io-interactive/"" target=""_blank"">dropping in July</a>.</p>
<h2>A new way to play</h2>
<p>The upcoming <em>Freelancer </em>mode is being billed as a roguelike adaptation of the <em>Hitman </em>formula. In it, Agent 47 will have a safehouse and series of contracts to carry out. Loadouts and mission planning can be set up in advance, and equipment can be acquired or lost in the field.</p>
<p>This mode <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/hitman-3-year-2-trilogy-revealed-freelancer-rocky-game-pass-steam/"" target=""_blank"">seems like</a> a way to not just test out veteran <em>Hitman </em>players, but to add some interesting wrinkles and challenges to the existing map pool. IO says today that it’s pushed beyond its initial scope for <em>Freelancer </em>to include “almost all locations” from the World of Assassination trilogy on day one. It’s also going to be a free update for <em>Hitman 3 </em>owners.</p>
<p>So if you’ve got <em>Hitman 3 </em>on PC via Steam, you might be able to hop into the <em>Freelancer </em>test. Otherwise, it’s headed to <em>Hitman 3 </em>owners on January 26, 2023.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

<h2>Sandworms, strategy, and a whole lotta spice</h2>
<p>Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of the 1965 sci-fi novel <em>Dune </em>went live in theaters and on HBO Max this weekend. But the silver screen isn’t the only medium that’s tried to bring the dunes of Arrakis to life. <i>Dune</i>‘s legacy in video games isn’t just notable, but groundbreaking in some respects—and a bit dramatic, too.</p>
<p>The last time we did this, around the premiere of <em>Evangelion</em>‘s <em><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/neon-genesis-evangelion-games-retrospective/"" target=""_blank"">Thrice Upon a Time</a>, </em>we dove into a line of visual novels, multimedia discs, and even a hidden gem of a Nintendo 64 game. The gaming legacy of <em>Dune </em>is a pretty remarkable one though, at least for one company in particular: Westwood. But let’s start at the beginning.</p>
<h3>Going back to <em>Dune</em></h3>
<p>There are, by a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_based_on_Dune"" target=""_blank"">general tally</a>, five licensed <em>Dune </em>games. There are also several board games, role-playing games, and even MUDs (a.k.a. Multi-User Dungeon) of <em>Dune</em>. But the commercial video game legacy of the books kicked off with 1992 game <em>Dune</em>. Well, one of them.</p>
<p>Developed by Cryo Interactive, <em>Dune (1992) </em>was released for MS-DOS and Amiga, and later came to Sega CD in 1993. It was one of the first floppy format games converted to CD, and this version included footage from the David Lynch adaptation, voice acting, and 3D-rendered scenes. It’s based on the original novel, following Paul Atreides as his family is given the fief of the desert planet Arrakis by the emperor. You’re tasked with managing relationships, both with local Fremen and the rival faction, Harkonnen.</p>
<p>It’s a mix of point-and-click adventure and real-time strategy, with both aspects playing into the success or failure of House Atreides. It’s pretty ahead of its time, with its mix of politics, dialogue, exploration, and strategy bringing to mind games like <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-divinity-dragon-commander/"" target=""_blank""><em>Divinity: Dragon Commander</em></a>.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/7J3OUT5rEYU?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>It had a <a href=""https://www.pcgamer.com/saturday-crapshoot-dune/"" target=""_blank"">reportedly troubled development</a>, and ultimately, found itself in competition with itself. Because <em>Dune (1992) </em>was not the only 1992 <em>Dune</em> game. All the while, another company was working on its own version of <em>Dune</em>, that also looked to strategy for inspiration.</p>
<h3>To command and conquer</h3>
<p>In December 1992, Westwood Studios released its own <em>Dune </em>video game under several different names. Known as <em>Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty</em>, <em>Dune II: Battle for Arrakis, Dune: Battle for Arrakis</em>, or just simply <em>Dune II</em>, it was also based on Lynch’s movie adaptation of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi novel.</p>
<p>In Westwood’s version, the player takes control of one of three houses: Atreides, Harkonnen, and the Ordos—that last one being a new addition for Westwood’s game. The goal is to take control of Arrakis from the other two houses by harvesting spice and building up cash, eventually funding an army to crush the enemy.</p>
<p>If it sounds familiar, well, that’s because <em>Dune II </em>was essentially the blueprint for many real-time strategy games to come, including Westwood’s <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>.</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dune2000_102321.jpg?resize=640%2C400"" alt=""Dune II"" /></p>
<p>In a feature on the making of the game in <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20130212081135/https://www.edge-online.com/features/the-making-of-dune-ii/"" target=""_blank""><em>Edge</em></a>, Westwood co-founder and <em>Dune II </em>producer Brett Sperry credited a few sources of inspiration: partly <em>Populous</em>, party his work on <em>Eye of the Beholder</em>, and most crucially, an argument he once had with Strategic Simulations vice president Chuck Kroegel. Wargames “sucked,” as Sperry said, because of a lack of innovation and poor design. He recalls Kroegel saying the category was a in “long, slow decline” as players moved to more exciting genres.</p>
<p>“I felt that the genre had a lot of potential—the surface was barely scratched as far as I was concerned, especially from a design standpoint,” Sperry told <em>Edge</em>. “So I took it as a personal challenge and figured how to harness real-time dynamics with great game controls into a fast-paced wargame.”</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/EmperorBattleForDune_102321.jpg?resize=640%2C480"" alt=""Emperor: Battle for Dune"" /></p>
<p>The result was the real-time strategy game, something experimented with already by 1990’s <em>Herzog Zwei</em>, and now codified in <em>Dune II</em>. The game would become a success, leading to a semi-remake in <em>Dune 2000 </em>and <em>Emperor: Battle for Dune </em>in 2001.</p>
<p>It would also lead Westwood to create the <em>Command &amp; Conquer </em>series using a similar design philosophy, and it became a pivotal game in the PC strategy space.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8q93dDB_O0?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<h3>Return of Cryo</h3>
<p>Cryo Interactive, however, was not done with <em>Dune. </em>The developer would return to Herbert’s sci-fi novel in 2001 with <em>Frank Herbert</em><em>‘s Dune</em>.

Sandworms, strategy, and a whole lotta spice
Denis Villeneuve’s adaptation of the 1965 sci-fi novel Dune went live in theaters and on HBO Max this weekend. But the silver screen isn’t the only medium that’s tried to bring the dunes of Arrakis to life. Dune‘s legacy in video games isn’t just notable, but groundbreaking in some respects—and a bit dramatic, too.
The last time we did this, around the premiere of Evangelion‘s Thrice Upon a Time, we dove into a line of visual novels, multimedia discs, and even a hidden gem of a Nintendo 64 game. The gaming legacy of Dune is a pretty remarkable one though, at least for one company in particular: Westwood. But let’s start at the beginning.
Going back to Dune
There are, by a general tally, five licensed Dune games. There are also several board games, role-playing games, and even MUDs (a.k.a. Multi-User Dungeon) of Dune. But the commercial video game legacy of the books kicked off with 1992 game Dune. Well, one of them.
Developed by Cryo Interactive, Dune (1992) was released for MS-DOS and Amiga, and later came to Sega CD in 1993. It was one of the first floppy format games converted to CD, and this version included footage from the David Lynch adaptation, voice acting, and 3D-rendered scenes. It’s based on the original novel, following Paul Atreides as his family is given the fief of the desert planet Arrakis by the emperor. You’re tasked with managing relationships, both with local Fremen and the rival faction, Harkonnen.
It’s a mix of point-and-click adventure and real-time strategy, with both aspects playing into the success or failure of House Atreides. It’s pretty ahead of its time, with its mix of politics, dialogue, exploration, and strategy bringing to mind games like Divinity: Dragon Commander.

It had a reportedly troubled development, and ultimately, found itself in competition with itself. Because Dune (1992) was not the only 1992 Dune game. All the while, another company was working on its own version of Dune, that also looked to strategy for inspiration.
To command and conquer
In December 1992, Westwood Studios released its own Dune video game under several different names. Known as Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty, Dune II: Battle for Arrakis, Dune: Battle for Arrakis, or just simply Dune II, it was also based on Lynch’s movie adaptation of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi novel.
In Westwood’s version, the player takes control of one of three houses: Atreides, Harkonnen, and the Ordos—that last one being a new addition for Westwood’s game. The goal is to take control of Arrakis from the other two houses by harvesting spice and building up cash, eventually funding an army to crush the enemy.
If it sounds familiar, well, that’s because Dune II was essentially the blueprint for many real-time strategy games to come, including Westwood’s Command &amp; Conquer.

In a feature on the making of the game in Edge, Westwood co-founder and Dune II producer Brett Sperry credited a few sources of inspiration: partly Populous, party his work on Eye of the Beholder, and most crucially, an argument he once had with Strategic Simulations vice president Chuck Kroegel. Wargames “sucked,” as Sperry said, because of a lack of innovation and poor design. He recalls Kroegel saying the category was a in “long, slow decline” as players moved to more exciting genres.
“I felt that the genre had a lot of potential—the surface was barely scratched as far as I was concerned, especially from a design standpoint,” Sperry told Edge. “So I took it as a personal challenge and figured how to harness real-time dynamics with great game controls into a fast-paced wargame.”

The result was the real-time strategy game, something experimented with already by 1990’s Herzog Zwei, and now codified in Dune II. The game would become a success, leading to a semi-remake in Dune 2000 and Emperor: Battle for Dune in 2001.
It would also lead Westwood to create the Command &amp; Conquer series using a similar design philosophy, and it became a pivotal game in the PC strategy space.

Return of Cryo
Cryo Interactive, however, was not done with Dune. The developer would return to Herbert’s sci-fi novel in 2001 with Frank Herbert‘s Dune. It was based on the Sci Fi Channel miniseries from 2000, and opted for an adventure game setup in 3D, following Paul Atreides’ efforts to win over the Fremen and take down Baron Harkonnen.
It arrived in the midst of troubles for the studio, and sadly, Cryo began to slowly fold and dissolve not long after the launch of Frank Herbert’s Dune. As its subsidiaries and studios closed, it took another Dune game with it: the ongoing project Dune Generations.
Though fan-created legacy versions of these older games and mods for other games keep the Dune spirit alive, the sci-fi series’ video game future is nebulous. The work to bring Dune back to the gaming space is underway, though it remains to be seen what shape that will take or when.
Yet despite an absence in recent memory, the Dune series’ video game adaptations left a permanent mark in the games industry. From a sincerely fascinating adventure-strategy hybrid to becoming the blueprint for a new genre of strategy entirely, Dune‘s mark on games can still be seen today, even if it’s just in modern remakes of its successors. And hopefully, someday, we’ll visit the virtual dunes of Arrakis again.

<h2>I was starting to fear the worst</h2>
<p>Much to fans’ delight, <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-returnal/"" target=""_blank""><em>Returnal</em></a> isn’t done yet. They’ve been clamoring for more content, especially after <a href=""https://twitter.com/Housemarque/status/1464238590251212801"" target=""_blank"">a recent Twitter teaser,</a> and it’s actually coming this month. During this afternoon’s State of Play stream, Housemarque announced <em>Returnal: Ascension</em> — a new challenge tower, and co-op support, are arriving on March 22 with the 3.0 update.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZsVRtrRsUBk?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>To quickly touch on the “endless” content, there’s a new how-far-can-you-get activity called the <strong>Tower of Sisyphus</strong> that’s playable after you’ve gotten the Icarian Grapnel (grapple hook) after beating the second boss. According to Sony, this is “an ascending gauntlet of increasingly dangerous phases, with each containing twenty floors.”</p>
<p>You’ll need to clear out “all the enemies on each floor and secure your passage to the next one up.” It’s essentially a score-chasing arcade experience with a multiplier (which used to be Housemarque’s wheelhouse), with some “new narrative content to be explored.”</p>
<p><strong>Co-op</strong> is also coming on March 22, but it’s specifically for the main <em>Returnal</em> campaign — so the “Tower of Sisyphus, House sequences, and Challenge Mode” are excluded.</p>
<p>“By accessing the <strong>Chronosis portal near the crash landing</strong> (and in other select parts of the game), you’ll have the option to either <strong>host or join a public cycle</strong>. Or, if you’d like to share the experience with a friend, you can also choose to <strong>host a private cycle</strong> instead,” <a href=""https://blog.playstation.com/2022/03/09/returnal-ascension-update-adds-co-op-and-tower-of-sisyphus-mode/"" target=""_blank"">Housemarque explained</a> in a post-show announcement on the PlayStation Blog.</p>
<p>“If players get too far apart, they will be tethered back together. This is to ensure that the focus remains on cooperative gameplay and both players feel connected to the fates of each other. If one of the players is downed, there is still hope: the other one has the option to revive them.”</p>
<p><img src=""https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Returnal-co-op-gameplay.jpg?resize=640%2C360"" alt=""Returnal co-op screenshot"" /></p>
<p>Tethering concerns aside, my mind also went straight to co-op progression.</p>
<p>Here’s the rundown: “<strong>Progression is tied to the host</strong>, so if you’re struggling to overcome a certain boss or biome, bringing in another player to help may open your road to triumph. Client players who join to help will also get to <strong>keep some progress</strong> they make — such as collecting <strong>logs and xenoglyphs</strong> — and the more games they assist with the more their Scout Rank will grow.”</p>
<p>I’m super curious how online co-op will be balanced (in terms of damage, health, enemy spawns, etc.), as this is a really tricky game for some of us. I actually made an effort to try and finish <em>Returnal</em> recently, but then <em>Elden Ring</em> consumed my life. I’m glad it’s still installed on my PS5 with the Ascension update incoming in under two weeks.</p>
<p>“This was our effort towards expanding the lasting power of <em>Returnal</em>, and we hope to see players engage with our new modes for years to come,” said game director Harry Krueger.</p>

<h2>It’s a permanent fixture on my Switch</h2>
<p>When word got out that <em><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/yep-i-m-addicted-to-hyrule-warriors-all-over-again-on-switch-502252.phtml"" target=""_blank"">Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition</a> </em>would make it over to Nintendo Switch, I had mixed emotions. The original Wii U version of the horde-clearing, fort-capturing action game was a revelation for me: it was the first time I truly “got” a <em>Musou</em> / <em>Warriors</em> game, and not for lack of trying. Playing as and fighting familiar <em>Zelda</em> characters made all the difference. I was <em>hooked</em>.</p>
<p>I’m not much of a handheld gamer, so <em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/review-hyrule-warriors-legends-348883.phtml"">Hyrule Warriors Legends</a> </em>came and went. On-the-fly character switching, new story segments based on Linkle and <em>Wind Waker</em>, and a new My Fairy system to further bolster The Grind all sounded like fine additions. But it doesn’t take long for my hands to cramp while holding a 3DS, and at that time, I was still feeling burned out from the Wii U game. No thanks!</p>
<p>Flash forward to the launch of <em>Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition</em> back in May, and you could see my conundrum. It’s a question plenty of <em>Hyrule Warriors </em>players faced: “There are so many other great games I could be playing on Switch. Do I really <em>need</em> to get caught up in this time sink again?”</p>
<p>The answer for me was “no,” but that didn’t stop me. I’ve forced my way through the admittedly drawn-out story mode and now I’m working my way through the Adventure maps. There’s no end in sight.</p>

<p>Adventure Mode is ingenious. It’s made up of nine different maps, each inspired by a different <em>Zelda </em>game and each with their own gimmicks. Every tile on the map represents a level with varying goals, win/defeat conditions, and rewards. You might need to slay three King Dodongos as Ghirahim (within a certain time limit, and without taking too much damage) to earn him a Heart Container. Or maybe you need to clear out 400 enemies before the AI does to unlock a colorful new Great Sea outfit for Link.</p>
<p>The levels are usually short and rewarding enough that I can knock out a string of them in one sitting and not know where the time went. They also make me bounce around the 29-character roster rather than just stick with Link and the Master Sword all the time. I may not want to play as the bug-loving Agitha, but if I invest some resources into powering her up and I earn an A rank on this particular level, I’ll open up a path on the map to a far-off tile offering a higher-tier weapon for my boy Volga.</p>

<p><em>Hyrule Warriors</em>‘ <a href=""https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/switch/230454-hyrule-warriors-definitive-edition/faqs/76806"" target=""_blank"">Adventure Mode</a> reminds me of doing jigsaw puzzles. It’s not too mindless or taxing, and if you’re ever stuck or you aren’t motivated to tackle a tricky section, you can move onto something else and still make progress. The overall goal of completing the puzzle can be daunting, but if you break it up into digestible chunks, you’ll eventually get there. You’re always moving forward.</p>
<p>That light and breezy gameplay loop existed in <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> before <em>Definitive Edition</em>, but it’s even more potent on Nintendo Switch because the system is just a joy to play on. It’s so convenient to pop out my Switch, play a few levels while watching a show, and then slide it back into the dock.</p>

<p>After a few high-profile sequels during the PS5 reveal event, Sony shifted the spotlight to <em>Stray</em>, an animal adventure game in which humans are seemingly long gone and robots walk the graffiti-tagged streets. For a split-second, I had <em>Tokyo Jungle</em> flashbacks before I came to my senses. Let me dream.</p>
<p>With assistance from Annapurna Interactive, the team at BlueTwelve was inspired by the real-world Kowloon Walled City for <em>Stray</em>‘s setting. “Exploring the strange world we are building feels really fresh when you’re sneaking under a car, or walking the rooftops with the inhabitants below unaware of your presence. Or if you want them to be aware, you can just meow endlessly to annoy them.”</p>
<p>The game revolves around exploration, puzzles, and more “fast-paced action sequences.” <em>Stray</em> isn’t launching until 2021, but it looks like a cool wildcard release, especially coming from Annapurna.</p>
<p>The publisher is calling this a “PlayStation 5 console exclusive.”</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>

RIP humans

After a few high-profile sequels during the PS5 reveal event, Sony shifted the spotlight to Stray, an animal adventure game in which humans are seemingly long gone and robots walk the graffiti-tagged streets. For a split-second, I had Tokyo Jungle flashbacks before I came to my senses. Let me dream.
With assistance from Annapurna Interactive, the team at BlueTwelve was inspired by the real-world Kowloon Walled City for Stray‘s setting. “Exploring the strange world we are building feels really fresh when you’re sneaking under a car, or walking the rooftops with the inhabitants below unaware of your presence. Or if you want them to be aware, you can just meow endlessly to annoy them.”
The game revolves around exploration, puzzles, and more “fast-paced action sequences.” Stray isn’t launching until 2021, but it looks like a cool wildcard release, especially coming from Annapurna.
The publisher is calling this a “PlayStation 5 console exclusive.”

		Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs
Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.
The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.

In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.
The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.

<h2>Here’s a classic cinematic clip to prove it!</h2>
<p>In what might be the leakiest BlizzCon yet, we knew a new form of <em>Overwatch</em> was coming. Was it <em>Overwatch 2</em>? Is it an <em>Overwatch </em>1.5? No, it’s <em>Overwatch 2</em>, as per the marketing materials. Blizzard shared the news today by way of a cinematic trailer in true BlizzCon fashion. Echo made an appearance, as did most of the classic good-guy gang.</p>
<p>Story missions (PVE) are a thing, as are hero missions (“highly replayable co-op experiences”), and it seems like we’re getting an actual…story this time. There’s new PVP maps as well (Toronto is the first Canadian map!), on top of a new look and new heroes like <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://v1cdn.destructoid.com/BlizzConRecap1.jpg"">Sojourn</a>. The classic heroes are getting a new look as well and the engine is being upgraded.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick rundown of the PVE component: “Players will take an active role in the <em>Overwatch</em> saga as a new global crisis unfolds through a series of intense, high-stakes four-player missions. As the story progresses, players will team up as different sets of heroes and fight to defend the world from the omnic forces of Null Sector, uncover the motives behind the robotic armies’ attacks, and come face-to-face with rising new threats around the globe.”</p>
<p>Director Jeff Kaplan notes that there will be a brand new “core” game mode called Push that will be featured in the Overwatch League. Kaplan promises “tons of PVE content” and the first map, Rio, is playable today at BlizzCon. He also says that “sequels make [Blizzard] nervous,” and the company is “redefining what a sequel means.” All original players of the current game will get to play on the same maps as <em>Overwatch 2 </em>players and progression will carry over.</p>
<p>“Does this mean Overwatch is back?” “Yes, yes we are.”</p>

		<h2>Rumble Roses</h2>
<p>Something<em> very</em> special from the Arcade Archives this week, as Hamster takes time out from its recent Namco obsession to deliver not only a Tecmo title, but a fun, silly, and particularly obscure one at that — Available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch its forgotten fighter <em>Angel Eyes!</em></p>
<p>Released to Japanese arcades in 1996, <em>Angel Eyes</em> — or to give it its full title<em> Tōkidenshō Angel Eyes</em> — is a super cult 2D fighter that was renowned for sporting an All Anime Gal cast of scrappers. A selection of fun character tropes, including a school girl, a volleyball player, a kunoichi, an arrogant “ojou” woman, and a young girl with a giant teddy bear (<a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/dnf-duel-enchantress-trailer-nexon-fighting-games-arcsys/"" target=""_blank"">predating Enchantress by several decades</a>), fight it out in cute ‘n’ colorful action, set against the backdrop of some equally strange locations, such as a fun fair, and a medieval castle!</p>
<p>Check out the cute ‘n’ crazy carnage in the video below, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR2L0bPxY_M"" target=""_blank"">courtesy of YouTuber Colmarr.</a></p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/hR2L0bPxY_M?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Angel Eyes</em>, despite its seeming irrelevance, had some surprisingly prescient ideas. Not only is it one of the first-ever “all women” fighting games, but it is also one of the first 2D fighters to feature a heavy slant on juggles and air combos. Perhaps its funniest and most bizarre mechanic, however, is reserved for the so-called “reverse combo correction” system, which actually<em> increases</em> damage the longer a combo goes on — rather than scales it back. And thus, players with one or two fairly solid combos can find themselves taking down their opponents in a manner of seconds.</p>
<p>You thought <em>Street Fighter V</em> was “three mistakes to death”? Try “one mistake to death”!</p>
<p>Despite its simplistic nature and dopey mechanics, Angel Eyes is, understandably, not without its charm. Though it would receive a JPN PlayStation point in 1997, the series would quietly disappear into the annals of fighting game history. Still, it’s lovely to see it again. And, as opposed to a lot of the Arcade Archives releases, <em>Angel Eyes</em> is a title that actually requires archiving, due to its obscure, rare nature.</p>
<p><em>Angel Eyes</em> is available to download now on PS4 and Nintendo Switch, priced at around $8.</p>

<h2>Don’t stay out too late</h2>
<p>I didn’t know I needed a creepy fishing game, and that’s where <em>Dredge</em> comes in.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.team17.com/team17-presents-dredge/"" target=""_blank"">In this drifting exploration game</a>, you’ll head out on a trawler in search of fish and “long-buried secrets.” It’s a peaceful(ish) job during the day, but when the sun goes down, horrible creatures surface.

<p><em>Dredge</em> is the debut title from Christchurch-based Black Salt Games and publisher Team17, who has a knack for finding projects with intriguing new concepts in familiar genres.</p>
<p>This trailer is more about establishing the serene-meets-sinister vibe of <em>Dredge</em>, which is fine — it serves its purpose. But if you want to see gameplay, I’d check out the <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/1562430/DREDGE/"" target=""_blank"">Steam page</a> for some more illuminating screenshots and gifs. The lighting is fantastic.</p>
<h2>Yer fond of me lobster, ain’t ye?</h2>
<p>I like the idea of roaming between islands for quests, snatching up and selling sell fish, earning enough money to upgrade the ship, and heading out into the great unknown, potentially at my own peril. The inventory system also catches my eye as a perpetual <em>Resident Evil 4</em> replayer; it’s going to be fun to twist and turn odd-shaped items (in this case, fish and gear) to squeeze them all into a tight space to maximize trips.</p>

<p>I’m hazy on how the nighttime mechanics work — how screwed are we? — but the scenery is unnerving. (And I’m generally not one to be too put off by freaky <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-subnautica/"" target=""_blank""><em>Subnautica</em></a>-sized sea creatures.) As the creators of <em>Dredge</em> put it, you’ll be able to “strengthen your mind and use special abilities to survive trips out on the water after dark.”</p>
<p><em>Dredge</em> is launching in 2023 on Nintendo Switch, PC (via Steam), PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. There’s much more to see before then, and I’ll be keeping tabs.</p>

<h2>It’s even got Tournament Fighters for NES</h2>
<p>Though it’s looking great, <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/master-splinter-playable-character-tmnt-shredders-revenge-trailer-news/"" target=""_blank""><em>Shredder’s Revenge</em></a> isn’t the only game to look forward to this year for brawler fans. A wide-ranging <em>TMNT</em> compilation is also on the way, as announced during today’s State of Play. Konami tapped Digital Eclipse for <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</em>, a package containing arcade, console, and handheld titles.</p>

<p>What retro games are included? Essentially, all of them. There’s “13 console and arcade games and their regional versions,” which spans <em>Turtles in Time</em>, <em>The Hyperstone Heist</em>, the NES games, the Game Boy games, and multiple versions of <em>Tournament Fighters</em>. Strap in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (<strong>Arcade</strong>)</li>

</ul>
<p>The arcade inclusions — <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> and <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time</em> — will let “you and up to three friends have the arcade experience at home on your couch or online,” according to Konami. “The 8-bit <em>TMNT II: The Arcade Game</em>, <em>TMNT III: The Manhattan Project</em>, and the 16-bit <em>TMNT IV: Turtles in Time</em>, and <em>The Hyperstone Heist</em> will also have all the local multi-player fun of yesteryear.”</p>
<p>“Additionally, never-before-seen development art, sketches and game design material will also be included.”</p>
<p>We’re dipping back into the 8- and 16-bit era, which is a partially comfy, partially nerve-wracking time for <em>TMNT</em> games. Thankfully, that’s where modern features can lend a hand.</p>

<h2>Yeah, this was worth bringing back again</h2>
<p>It’s hard to really stress how incredible <em>Tactics Ogre</em>‘s legacy is. Originally debuting in 1995 in Japan, it gained a lot of traction in 1997 on PlayStation with a North American release. While I can distinctly point to January of 1998, and <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>, as the time where I went “yeah, I’m pretty into SRPGs,” <em>Tactics Ogre</em> really was the genesis of it, beyond what I had dabbled in before it. It was the talk of my friend groups, and got so many people into the genre. <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.destructoid.com/tactics-ogre-reborn-leak-playstation-store-square-enix/"">So when, out of nowhere</a>, I learned that it was coming back in 2022 (beyond the PSP edition) as Tactics Ogre: Reborn, I was ecstatic.</p>
<p>Yes, let’s rediscover one of the most interesting SRPGs ever made, through a modern lens, with a completely new audience in play. <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVNyoeik0ig"">This “final trailer”</a> that arrived today on Square Enix’s YouTube shows off what we can expect before it hits on PC, Switch, PS4, and PS5 on November 11. It’s basically an overview of the themes and mechanics of the game, but if you want to completely skip most of the story beats (as vague as they may be), I recommend watching everything 1:30 on.</p>
<p>As a reiteration, here’s everything Square Enix is touting as new:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Based on the 2010 release, the game features improved graphics and sound, as well as updated game design, bringing to life a new <em>Tactics Ogre</em> that remains true to its roots. <em>Tactics Ogre</em> veterans will experience a game that surpasses their fondest memories, while players new to <em>Tactics Ogre</em> will discover a game unlike any they’ve ever played. Reborn and deeper than ever, the game enables players to immerse themselves in the world and intrigue of<em> Tactics Ogre</em> like never before.”</p></blockquote>
<p>To stress again: definitely put this on your radar. <em>Tactics Ogre</em> is an evergreen story, and one that should live on through as many platforms as possible. The easier it is to experience this vision, the better: especially given that the PSP storefront is dead. Thankfully, at the very least, PSP copies are fairly cheap, running folks around $40 on average.</p>
<p>See, I’m already prepping you for picking up every version of this game early!</p>

<h2>Mecha tactics are back in season</h2>
<p><em>Front Mission </em>is a piece of Square’s history that is exciting to see return. The strategic maneuvering of Wanzers around environments and big mech management makes it stand out a bit from the PlayStation 1 era of RPGs.</p>
<p>It’s been a tactics-heavy year, too. <em><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-triangle-strategy/"" target=""_blank"">Triangle Strategy</a> </em>started the year off strong, <em><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/tactics-ogre-reborn-still-looks-dope-as-hell-in-final-trailer/"" target=""_blank"">Tactics Ogre: Reborn</a> </em>is right around the corner, and a new <em><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/nintendo-announces-fire-emblem-engage/"" target=""_blank"">Fire Emblem</a> </em>is just a few months away.</p>
<p>With three remakes currently set out, <em>Front Mission 1st: Remake </em>will get to set the tone for what’s to come with these updated <em>Front Mission </em>titles. But hopefully it turns out strong. <em>Front Mission </em>is a neat series I’ve wanted to go back to for a while. Making these entries easily accessible, and putting them on the Switch at that, seems like a worthy endeavor.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

		<h2>Everyone’s entitled to one good scare</h2>
<p>So said Charles Cyphers’ Sherriff Brackett in John Carpenter’s seminal classic, <em>Halloween</em>… He also said it in David Gordon Green’s not-so-seminal <em>Halloween Kills</em>, despite it being 40 years later, and <em>nobody</em> in the scene having been on-site for the first time he said it. Still, that’s the DGG Halloween trilogy to a tee: Remember that? Here it is again! (also, mobs are bad). I saw Halloween Ends. I don’t hate it like most hate it, but it does feel like a film made while the crew was giggling and saying “The fans will be SO mad!”</p>
<p>Howdy friends, and welcome to this <em>super scary</em> edition of Whatcha Been Playing? And by “super scary” I mean, “It was really scary on Tuesday when a flood completely ruined my kitchen and made me cry”. I appreciate the support lent to me in Qposts and social media, and repairs are currently in process. It was a nightmare, and I had to move out for a bit, but it could have been so much worse, and we all have to be grateful for the small mercies. The water didn’t hit my Lucky Chloe figurine, is what I’m saying.</p>
<p>A nightmare week, but it’s done, and now it’s the weekend, so let’s make it a good one.</p>
<h2>See anything you like?</h2>
<p>Usually, I’d be telling you the games that have been filling my time, but obviously the above events put paid to that. I’m also too busy for gaming this weekend, as I’m heading out of town for an industry-based Halloween party. It’s the first party I’ve attended in many, many years, and will be the first time I’ve worn a “costume” as such in decades, so it’s a bit weird and I’m a little anxious, but it should be fun. I’m determined to go, in order to salvage something from the week and get away from my smelly house.</p>
<p>My costume? Well, I could go as something instantly recognizable, but instead, I’m going to be awkward and clunky and go as the villainous Rose the Hat from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Sleep_(2019_film)"" target=""_blank"">Stephen King’s <em>Doctor Sleep</em></a>. I’m doing this because I like that movie, I like Rebecca Ferguson, and I don’t think I can pull off <em>Dune</em>‘s Lady Jessica of the Atreides. Are these the only reasons? I can’t get into that. If I look good, I’ll share photos in the comments, Qposts, or on my Twitter. <em>Only</em> if I look good, however.</p>
<p>A reader suggested I should go as Juri… Lordy, I know Halloween is <em>supposed</em> to be scary, but…</p>
<h2>It <em>was</em> The Boogeyman…</h2>

		Everyone’s entitled to one good scare
So said Charles Cyphers’ Sherriff Brackett in John Carpenter’s seminal classic, Halloween… He also said it in David Gordon Green’s not-so-seminal Halloween Kills, despite it being 40 years later, and nobody in the scene having been on-site for the first time he said it. Still, that’s the DGG Halloween trilogy to a tee: Remember that? Here it is again! (also, mobs are bad). I saw Halloween Ends. I don’t hate it like most hate it, but it does feel like a film made while the crew was giggling and saying “The fans will be SO mad!”
Howdy friends, and welcome to this super scary edition of Whatcha Been Playing? And by “super scary” I mean, “It was really scary on Tuesday when a flood completely ruined my kitchen and made me cry”. I appreciate the support lent to me in Qposts and social media, and repairs are currently in process. It was a nightmare, and I had to move out for a bit, but it could have been so much worse, and we all have to be grateful for the small mercies. The water didn’t hit my Lucky Chloe figurine, is what I’m saying.
A nightmare week, but it’s done, and now it’s the weekend, so let’s make it a good one.
See anything you like?
Usually, I’d be telling you the games that have been filling my time, but obviously the above events put paid to that. I’m also too busy for gaming this weekend, as I’m heading out of town for an industry-based Halloween party. It’s the first party I’ve attended in many, many years, and will be the first time I’ve worn a “costume” as such in decades, so it’s a bit weird and I’m a little anxious, but it should be fun. I’m determined to go, in order to salvage something from the week and get away from my smelly house.
My costume? Well, I could go as something instantly recognizable, but instead, I’m going to be awkward and clunky and go as the villainous Rose the Hat from Stephen King’s Doctor Sleep. I’m doing this because I like that movie, I like Rebecca Ferguson, and I don’t think I can pull off Dune‘s Lady Jessica of the Atreides. Are these the only reasons? I can’t get into that. If I look good, I’ll share photos in the comments, Qposts, or on my Twitter. Only if I look good, however.
A reader suggested I should go as Juri… Lordy, I know Halloween is supposed to be scary, but…
It was The Boogeyman…
And speaking of comments, it’s time to hear yours. As you might have noticed, Destructoid’s comment section is in the middle of something of an overhaul. If you click the “Join the Conversation” button below, the comments should just slide in. The button should be white text on red. If it is not responding, then clearing your browser cache should fix it. It has for most. If you have trouble signing back in, please check out this previous Disqus fix. A lot of people have asked me why this change has happened and if it’s permanent. Those questions are somewhat in the clouds, and I never want to give you, the community, any answers unless I know can give you the square facts.
All I can say is that, under the new ownership, there may be an extended period of investigation and experimentation with Destructoid. Try some stuff, change some stuff, remove some elements, add others, change things back, find what’s broken, and study analytics… There is no “Press a button and Destructoid becomes all things to all people”.

<h2>Behold the king; the king of kings</h2>
<p>All I want from a modern <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> video game is a virtual approximation of the tabletop role-playing game. We already have hack-and-slash games, we already have dungeon crawlers, that road has been well-tread. I want a god damn <em><span>D&amp;D</span></em> game; a sprawling, epic campaign with plenty of dialogue and a veritable spreadsheet of numbers hovering over me like a mathemagical Sword of Damocles.</p>
<p>So, hey, good news. <em>Pathfinder: Kingmaker</em> might not be an exact 5e <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> video game, but it’s close – it’s a <em>Pathfinder</em> video game. You know<em> Pathfinder</em>, that old standby of tabletop fans who never really let go of <em>D&amp;D</em> 3.5. <em>Pathfinder</em> is to <em>D&amp;D</em> what <em>ARMA </em>was to<em> Call of Duty</em>, in video game terms.</p>
<p>But while <em>D&amp;D</em> is out here remastering <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planescape:_Torment#Legacy"" target=""_blank"">old video games</a> and enjoying the <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/tabletop-centric-pax-unplugged-announced-set-for-nov-2017-in-philadelphia-414843.phtml"" target=""_blank"">tabletop renaissance</a>, <em>Pathfinder</em> is going after the interactive entertainment market while the CRPG iron is hot. <em>Kingmaker</em> plays fine, and it has many of the underlying systems I’d want from a tabletop adaptation, I just don’t know if the full game will be able to hang with actual <em>Pathfinder</em> or the other Kickstarted CRPGs floating around.</p>
<p><em>Kingmaker</em> reminds me of <em>Fable 3</em>, which is normally an unkind comparison. You’re a Baron or Baroness who will eventually rise to the rank of King or Queen, and you’re the kind of ruler who likes to get their hands dirty. It’s like Harrison Ford in <em>Air Force One</em>! You can either choose to make each decision yourself, or appoint a leader <em>in absentia</em> to make decisions in your absence. That leader’s <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_&amp;_Dragons)"">alignment</a> (Chaotic Good, Lawful Evil, True Neutral, etc.) will determine the kind of choices they’ll make. The player’s alignment isn’t set in stone, on the other hand – your actions will shape your alignment as well, which affects your standing in the world and the kind of companions you keep.</p>
<p><iframe width=""1280"" height=""720"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/KN0tIbQUkA8"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>
<p>During my time with the <em>Kingmaker</em> demo, I took more joy from solving problems and making dialogue choices than I did from any one combat encounter. Monster fighting is fairly standard – you click on things until they’re dead, with abilities tied to hotkeys occasionally making an appearance. You can control your party members directly, or just let the AI handle things, which seemed fairly viable. But there’s so much dialogue and flavor text out there to read, so if I end up playing the full game, I’ll probably spend most of my time looking for ways around the combat.</p>
<p>The “role playing” part of this role-playing game may not be as fluid as an authentic <em>Pathfinder</em> game, since the game is working from a set list of options rather than the (hopefully) limitless imagination of a Dungeon Master, but that set list felt deep and expansive. I don’t know if I could make the exact kind of Chaotic Good wizard I am perpetually drawn to in tabletop gaming (the kind who probably leans a little too “chaotic” for the group’s liking), but the <em>Kingmaker</em> demo led me to believe it was at least possible. </p>
<p>For as plentiful as the writing may be, those options won’t be as enticing if you turn up your nose at entry-level stuff like <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. The writing in <em>Kingmaker</em> seems like above-average fantasy writing, so if you’re already down with goblins and dwarves, you’ll be sated. But like I said, there is a <strong>lot</strong> of content; this is a rare case of quantity making up for quality.</p>
<p>Although the breadth of content in the <em>Kingmaker</em> demo makes me think it might be able to mimic the fluidity of a tabletop RPG campaign, there’s honestly no substitute for the real thing. I once played a mini-campaign that climaxed with my character was fistfighting with stevedores while my friends helped a vampire get ready for an all-night rager. Even if that kind of content is in<em> Kingmaker</em>, the nonsense I cited was the result of the DM reading the room and shifting accordingly.</p>
<p>Good tabletop gaming relies on action and reaction – and there’s definitely some of that in <em>Kingmaker</em>! The game throws something at you, you react, it reacts to your reaction, <em>et al</em>. <em>Kingmaker</em> will be a fine substitute if you can’t get a bunch of players together. But if you have a way to play tabletop RPGs with other people (especially now that <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://roll20.net/"">Roll20</a> is a thing) just do that. <em>Kingmaker</em> looks like a great RPG, but I left with a desire to play some tabletop RPGs with my friends rather than play more of this game. It’s fine on its own merits, it just reminded me of what I’d rather be doing with my time.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>

<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

<h2>Extra launchers are like per-channel streaming services: not needed</h2>
<p>Another launcher bits the dust. The Bethesda launcher is no more by the time May 2022 hits, and you can transfer to Steam a month early in April.</p>
<p>Here’s the gist, and the bolded part is important:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re saying goodbye to the Bethesda.net Launcher this year. We would like to thank you for your support and assure you that all of your games are safe. If you’re not playing PC games through the Bethesda.net launcher then your work is done here. Thanks for reading! If you do have games through the Bethesda.net launcher, don’t worry. Starting in early April you’ll be able to migrate your games and Wallet to your Steam account. For more details on what this process will look like, read on. You have plenty of time to plan and begin migrating your Bethesda.net library to your Steam account. <strong>The migration to Steam will include your game library and Wallet – meaning you will not lose anything from your Bethesda.net account</strong>.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Basically everything will transfer from the Bethesda launcher. Saves, character progress for <em>Fallout 76</em>, atoms (microtransaction currency), seasonal progress, friends lists, the works. The only game saves that cannot transfer, curiously, involve <em>Wolfenstein Youngblood</em>. This seems to be as painless as possible, which is a huge plus.</p>
<p>If you’re impacted, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://bethesda.net/en/article/2RXxG1y000NWupPalzLblG/sunsetting-the-bethesda-net-launcher-and-migrating-to-steam"">you can find the entire article here with all the details</a>. <em>Fallout 76</em> <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/FfWIVEmUL8vXXpAtkYnCT/farewell-bethesda-net-launcher-fallout-76-faq"">has its own FAQ here</a>, which is relevant because <strong>testing took place</strong> in the Bethesda launcher exclusively. According to the publisher, “going forward, playtesting for all future PTS phases will only be available on PC through Steam.” Again, easy!</p>
<p>As for the closure; competition is good, in theory. Steam is a monolith, and if someone wants to come along and provide products in a different way, with advantages (like how <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/tag/gog-com/"" target=""_blank"">GOG</a> provides DRM-free games), so be it. Competition benefits everyone, as Steam has added consumer-friendly features in direct response to other services in a bid to stay relevant.</p>

<h2>The Phantom Thieves strike again</h2>
<p><i><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/review-persona-5-424076.phtml"" target=""_blank"">Persona 5</a></i> is one of the most stylish JRPGs I’ve played in years.</p>
<p>From the moment it boots up and you hear that theme song: you’re probably in; and with one of the best soundtracks of all time, it’ll probably <em>keep you in</em> for most of that somewhat overly long 100-ish-hour runtime.</p>
<p><em>Persona 5 Royal</em> is a chance to relive that lengthy adventure all over again, but for a lot of people, once was probably enough.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i0.wp.com/v1cdn.destructoid.com/P5RR.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1"" /></p>
<p>We covered a lot of what made <em>Persona 5</em> special in the original review, but suffice to say <em>Royal</em> honors that legacy. Think of it like a re-release of sorts with upgrades peppered in and a giant story DLC baked into the conclusion.</p>
<p>For all but the most hardcore of fans, many of the differences are going to be subtle. Sure the new intro bit with the brand new character (that factors heavily into the new <em>Royal</em> storyline) is immediately noticeable, but the gist of running from the law and eventually getting caught is still the same. The big changes are that aforementioned party member (Kasumi), more cutscenes, an extended story and another semester.</p>
<p>The smaller alterations involve more gear, another true ending, slightly enhanced visuals on the PS4 Pro, more social link nuances, less pestering to go to bed and a new hub to chill at. The more you dig in, the more you’ll notice. Dungeons are slightly more involved with new layouts and the introduction of the grappling mechanic that gently prods more exploration. Hardcore players will love the enhanced Mementos (read: for the most part, the giant time-wasting randomized dungeon) mechanics that allow for longer grinding sessions.</p>

The Phantom Thieves strike again
Persona 5 is one of the most stylish JRPGs I’ve played in years.
From the moment it boots up and you hear that theme song: you’re probably in; and with one of the best soundtracks of all time, it’ll probably keep you in for most of that somewhat overly long 100-ish-hour runtime.
Persona 5 Royal is a chance to relive that lengthy adventure all over again, but for a lot of people, once was probably enough.

We covered a lot of what made Persona 5 special in the original review, but suffice to say Royal honors that legacy. Think of it like a re-release of sorts with upgrades peppered in and a giant story DLC baked into the conclusion.
For all but the most hardcore of fans, many of the differences are going to be subtle. Sure the new intro bit with the brand new character (that factors heavily into the new Royal storyline) is immediately noticeable, but the gist of running from the law and eventually getting caught is still the same. The big changes are that aforementioned party member (Kasumi), more cutscenes, an extended story and another semester.
The smaller alterations involve more gear, another true ending, slightly enhanced visuals on the PS4 Pro, more social link nuances, less pestering to go to bed and a new hub to chill at. The more you dig in, the more you’ll notice. Dungeons are slightly more involved with new layouts and the introduction of the grappling mechanic that gently prods more exploration. Hardcore players will love the enhanced Mementos (read: for the most part, the giant time-wasting randomized dungeon) mechanics that allow for longer grinding sessions.
“Showtime” abilities make combat a little flashier and more fun, and involve multiple party members to really hammer home some of the interpersonal relationships: it’s something that should have been in the base game. Nearly everything I came across is an upgrade, though some are less impactful than others, and the extra story doesn’t strike every chord it sets out to strike (Takuto, the new counselor, is the most fascinating thread, and there’s a lot to unpack when it comes to his narrative).

For that reason alone I can recommend Royal to two distinct groups: folks who play it yearly and are already itching to run through it again, and people who have never played Persona 5 at all. For the former group, you can fast-forward dialogue scenes and skip cutscenes that you’ve seen before to get to the new stuff. For the latter, you’re basically playing a Game of the Year edition.
It’s a tough situation. In another universe, Atlus would have added a few of the gameplay changes as free updates a while back, and sold the new 15-ish hour Royal backend story portion as paid DLC.  It’s different enough for me, someone who loved Persona 5 in the first place, to warrant another playthrough and future playthroughs in perpetuity. But if the original didn’t wow you, Royal won’t either.

<h2>And I could not be more excited</h2>
<p><em>Slay the Spire</em> is one of my most-played games of all time, so it’s always a pleasant surprise to see the little indie game that could from 2017 in the headlines. This time, there’s a <em>Slay the Spire</em> board game in the works, and in all honesty, I’m not much of a board game person, but I am willing to be if it means I get to play a physical version of my favorite deckbuilding roguelike.</p>
<p>Apparently I somehow missed the announcement that <em>Slay the Spire</em> was getting a board game adaptation two years ago, but the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/contentiongames/slay-the-spire-the-board-game"">Kickstarter page</a> for the project is officially launched. So far they’ve raised over $1.5 million, and I don’t really have any clue how much money it takes to make a board game, but that seems like a pretty substantial chunk of change in my book.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/uGfSp3Kz7rk?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>There are four pledge tiers ranging from $1 to $210 — the lowest tier gets you access to updates and the Pledge Manager at the end of the campaign, the $100 tier gives you the base game, the $145 version gets you the base game plus some extras like character play mats and metal coins, and that fancy $210 version gets you the game and a whole bunch of extras, like the aforementioned mats, coins, and some beta art, among other things.</p>
<p>There are already some reviews of the board game up online, and with all the little bits and baubles (that I am bound to lose) it seems that the mechanics are a very faithful adaptation of what we’re used to seeing in the video game. It looks to me like a pretty luxe purchase for collectors and fans of the game, so I’d probably suggest giving the original a few runs before playing if you haven’t already.</p>

		<h2>What do you mean ‘Who’s Captain Tomaday?’</h2>
<p>The retro-lovers over at QuByte Interactive have announced a brand new compilation spotlighting the works of lesser-remembered ’80s/’90s developer Visco Corporation — Now in development for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7lDgAJ63Uc&amp;t"" target=""_blank""><em>Visco Collection</em></a> offers a look back at some old-school arcade/Neo Geo releases.</p>
<p>The new compilation bundles together seven titles from the Visco archives, freshly emulated by indie developer PixelHeart. The game featured are Neo Geo shmup <em>Andro Dunos</em> (1992); futuristic sports game <em>Flip Shot</em> (1997) and its sequel <em>Bang Bead</em> (2000); side-scrolling actioner<em> Ganryu</em> (1999); rally racer<em> Neo Drift Out</em> (1996), soccer title<em> Goal! Goal! Goal!</em> (1995); and finally the bizarre, tomato-based shmup <em>Captain Tomaday</em> (1999).</p>

<p>No further details have been announced, so we do not know whether the collection will include online play, save states, a museum mode, or any of the other features typical of other retro collections — such as <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-capcom-arcade-stadium/"" target=""_blank""><em>Capcom Arcade Stadium</em></a>. There are some fun titles bundled here, though the only one I remember seeing quite commonly on the scene is <em>Neo Drift Out</em>. Importantly, however, Captain Tomaday is finally about to get his day in the sun, enjoying the fame and fortune that eluded the winged fruit during his initial run — smothered by the encroaching concerns of The Millennium Bug, no doubt.</p>

<h2>No hit, Herlock</h2>
<p>Today’s Capcom showcase for E3 2021 was <a href=""https://twitter.com/CapcomUSA_/status/1402249050532024321"" target=""_blank"">mostly what it laid out ahead of time</a>: a few spotlights on its upcoming slate of games, and some announcements of forthcoming plans for <em>Resident Evil Village </em>and <em>Monster Hunter </em><em>Rise</em>. There was also a big breakdown of what’s to come with the western launch of <em>The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles</em>, and folks, I’m very ready for more attorney action.</p>
<p>A new features trailer shown today highlighted the aspects of legal battles new to <em>The Great Ace Attorney</em>, specifically the Dance of Deduction and Summation Examination. Both the collaboration with ace investigator Herlock Sholmes (yes, Herlock Sholmes) and persuading the jury in court proceedings add some interesting layers to <em>The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles</em>.</p>

<p>The Summation Examination seems like a neat test of logic and reasoning, but I absolutely loved the segment with Herlock and protagonist Ryunosuke deducing that this bearded man was, in fact, someone in a disguise. After highlighting the golden locks flowing out from behind their hat, the pair strike poses in a fun bit of theatricality.</p>
<p>I’ve tried before to convince friends that they should give this series a shot, and honestly, this trailer might be the video I turn to from now on. It’s a great slice of both the mystery and court aspects of the <em>Ace Attorney </em>series at-large, and also highlights what makes <em>The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles </em>in particular stand out.</p>
<p>Safe to say I’m looking forward to solving many more head-scratchers when <em>The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles </em>hits Nintendo Switch, PS4, and PC on July 27.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>

In character action games, it was occasionally a new costume or some insane toggle that fundamentally transformed the game in some way. That’s enough for me.
But 900 Zelda: Breath of the Wild Korok Seeds with no real reward? That’s where I check out!

<p>Good news for PC shmuppers today, as City Connection <a href=""https://twitter.com/claricedisc/status/1583666682303635456?s=20&amp;t=bWibaHxGQ3WU3ZntQ5m5XA"" target=""_blank"">has announced</a> that Cave shmup <em>Akai Katana Shin</em> will be arriving on Steam on December 15, in alignment with its previously announced re-release on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/caves-akai-katana-shin-is-getting-a-re-release-in-december/"" target=""_blank"">As we have previously reported</a>, <em>Akai Katana Shin</em> originally launched on Xbox 360 in 2011, itself a remaster of Cave’s great 2010 arcade release. In typical Cave fashion the dazzling shmup features adrenaline-pumping, bullet-hell action, a beat-heavy soundtrack, and a melodramatic storyline that features a put-upon people, sick of being sacrificed to the titular totem, rising up against their oppressors in a bid for freedom.</p>
<p>Check out a preview of the re-release from April’s FES 2022 stream. The action starts at 33:30.</p>

<p>The new release will feature high-resolution visuals, a widescreen presentation format, and three individual modes to please both <em>Akai Katana</em> veterans and newcomers. <em>Akai Katana Origin</em> will replicate the 2010 arcade in all of its 4:3 glory, <em>Akai Katana Slash </em>will feature revised enemy patterns, new mechanics, and the aforementioned 16:9 screen ratio, while <em>Akai Katana Climax </em>will feature a blend of the previous modes, readjusted for balance. City Connection has noted that <em>Akai Katana Shin</em> will support multiple languages, including English, French, and Spanish.</p>
<p><em>Akai Katana Shin</em> launches December 15 on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. A physical release will follow in 2023 on PS4 and Nintendo Switch only.</p>

<h2>Art exhibition coming to Tokyo this summer</h2>
<p>This year sees the 20th anniversary of the cult JRPG franchise<em> .hack//</em>. To celebrate two decades of dystopian sci-fi action, publisher Bandai Namco has announced several different endeavors that will look back at the video games, manga, anime, and novels set within CyberConnect2’s new millennium.</p>
<p>The original run of the <em>.hack</em> manga has been digitally republished and is available for Japanese fans to purchase between now and July 4 directly from <a href=""https://www.cc2.co.jp/"" target=""_blank"">the CyberConnect2 website</a>. In addition, a special anniversary book will launch on July 19, looking back at every release in the series — from the original  2002 PS2 release <em>.hack//Infection </em>through collectible card title<em> .<i>hack//Enemy. </i></em>Unfortunately, Bandai Namco did not announce any plans to localize these re-releases for western fans.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ulUhubUdYc?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>A special exhibition will also be installed at Yurakucho Marui in Chiyoda, Tokyo between the dates of August 9 and August 28, 2022. The installation will feature original concept artwork and other audio/visual elements celebrating the multimedia franchise. In December, a second commemorative anniversary book will also be released, alongside a special three-CD set of <em>.hack</em>‘s evocative and melodramatic score.</p>
<p>But what in the way of new games? Well, Bandai Namco has not offered any such reveal, or even the announcement of a reveal, but mystery still surrounds the “Last Recollection” trademark, which the publisher filed <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/last-recollection-trademark-bandai-namco-mystery/"" target=""_blank"">back in April of this year</a>. It is believed that this pertains to an as-yet-unannounced set of the four mainline titles in the .hack franchise, namely <i>.hack//Infection</i>, <i>.hack//Mutation</i>, <i>.hack//Outbreak,</i> and finally <i>.hack//Quarantine</i>. So just sit tight for new news, hack squad.</p>

		<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs</h2>
<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/?guccounter=1"" target=""_blank"">TechCrunch Disrupt.</a></p>
<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny <a href=""https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-executive-producer-leaves-activision-blizzard-news/"" target=""_blank"">left the publisher in the fall of 2021</a>, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.</p>
<p><iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMdi0VlPJ0o?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.</p>
<p>The newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.</p>

<p>For the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as <em>Stranger Things</em> as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.</p>
