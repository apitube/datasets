                "content": "<div>\n\t\t<h2>Overwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs<\/h2>\n<p>Netflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/18\/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california\/?guccounter=1\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch Disrupt.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch.

The big gimmick? You can still play “old” battle passes and earn rewards, even after they’ve expired. If this really catches on, it has the chance to inspire the rest of the industry. For now, we have a little bit more info to go on for <em>Halo Infinite<\/em> season 1 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.halowaypoint.com\/en-us\/news\/inside-infinite-june-2021\" target=\"_blank\">thanks to a new blog update<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Live team design director Ryan Paradis stresses that seasons are the “core container or framework” for how content in <em>Infinite<\/em> works; and I have to say, with a lack of FOMO out of the gate, things are looking promising. Paradis re-iterates that “roughly every three months,” a new season will kick off, with “a ton of updates, content, events, systems, customizations, and progressions.” Naturally, some of that is cosmetics-related. The team notes that they’re committed to changing and addressing feedback going forward, but of course, like any game, how the first couple of months go will dictate how much the playerbase is willing to wait for potential course corrections.<\/p>\n<p>Paradis says that they’re sticking with three months because “it gives players a good amount of time to experience and explore” each season, and that just because content is coming in a three-month cadence, bug fixes will be evergreen. The team also chimes in that “it’s not a grind like it’s a job,” when ranking up seasons. Here’s a bit more info on that: “Almost every week will mix up the activities that are presented to the player. Certain big weeks will feature events that have new activities and specific reward tracks– free reward tracks. We will provide more details on specific events before launch but be on the lookout for a special event type with specific thematic rewards called a “Fracture.” The Battle Pass and other main vectors will supply canon customization. The Fracture and some events will at times lean into things further afield – like the Yoroi armor shown in the multiplayer trailer.”<\/p>\n<p>While direct content hasn’t been shown yet, we do know that Halo Infinite Season 1 is called “Heroes of Reach.” The team also leaves with a fairly big tease: “At the center of our plans is a goal to deeply root your Multiplayer character in the larger Halo universe and give them a vital, active role in the Halo story moving forward. How exactly we’re going to do this in the Seasons and years ahead… Well, we’re not ready to share details yet.”<\/p>\n<p>If they pull off something like <em>Mass Effect 3<\/em>‘s lore-based multiplayer, or <em>Fortnite<\/em>‘s ever-growing storyline-based seasonal tint, it could be really cool. For now, all we really know is that it’s kind of following a battle pass system where you can replay old passes. That could be good enough.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p><img alt src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/ChrisCarterAvatar-2-96x96.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/ChrisCarterAvatar-2-192x192.jpg 2x\" \/> <\/p>\n<div>\n<p><span>Reviews Director, Co-EIC - Chris has been enjoying Destructoid avidly since 2008.

                "textplain": "\n\n\n \n\nHere’s a few light details\nSo we found out at E3 that Halo Infinite would be doing seasons, but they’re going to be handling them a little differently than some other games. The big gimmick? You can still play “old” battle passes and earn rewards, even after they’ve expired. If this really catches on, it has the chance to inspire the rest of the industry. For now, we have a little bit more info to go on for Halo Infinite season 1 thanks to a new blog update.\nLive team design director Ryan Paradis stresses that seasons are the “core container or framework” for how content in Infinite works; and I have to say, with a lack of FOMO out of the gate, things are looking promising. Paradis re-iterates that “roughly every three months,” a new season will kick off, with “a ton of updates, content, events, systems, customizations, and progressions.” Naturally, some of that is cosmetics-related. The team notes that they’re committed to changing and addressing feedback going forward, but of course, like any game, how the first couple of months go will dictate how much the playerbase is willing to wait for potential course corrections.\nParadis says that they’re sticking with three months because “it gives players a good amount of time to experience and explore” each season, and that just because content is coming in a three-month cadence, bug fixes will be evergreen. The team also chimes in that “it’s not a grind like it’s a job,” when ranking up seasons. Here’s a bit more info on that: “Almost every week will mix up the activities that are presented to the player. Certain big weeks will feature events that have new activities and specific reward tracks– free reward tracks. We will provide more details on specific events before launch but be on the lookout for a special event type with specific thematic rewards called a “Fracture.” The Battle Pass and other main vectors will supply canon customization. The Fracture and some events will at times lean into things further afield – like the Yoroi armor shown in the multiplayer trailer.”\nWhile direct content hasn’t been shown yet, we do know that Halo Infinite Season 1 is called “Heroes of Reach.” The team also leaves with a fairly big tease: “At the center of our plans is a goal to deeply root your Multiplayer character in the larger Halo universe and give them a vital, active role in the Halo story moving forward. How exactly we’re going to do this in the Seasons and years ahead… Well, we’re not ready to share details yet.”\nIf they pull off something like Mass Effect 3‘s lore-based multiplayer, or Fortnite‘s ever-growing storyline-based seasonal tint, it could be really cool. For now, all we really know is that it’s kind of following a battle pass system where you can replay old passes. That could be good enough.\n\n \n\nReviews Director, Co-EIC - Chris has been enjoying Destructoid avidly since 2008. He finally decided to take the next step, make an account, and start blogging in January of 2009. Now, he's staff!\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tOverwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs\nNetflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service.

And we actually got a fair bit of info, not just in gameplay, but in what’s coming for the new look of <em>Halo <\/em>multiplayer.<\/p>\n<p><em>Halo Infinite<\/em> multiplayer will be a free-to-play experience (as has been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/halo-infinite-120-fps-multiplayer-series-x-holiday-release\/\" target=\"_blank\">previously announced<\/a>) for PC and Xbox. Alongside what you might expect from a usual <em>Halo<\/em> experience, like power weapons and vehicles, there are some new tools for destruction too; the grappling hook obviously changes up momentum, and you can also see points where the player grapples a hammer or power-up to themselves to pick up.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/n-O7OuliQRY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Equipment is also back, as is the Razorback, the Warthog’s sturdier cousin. The back of the Razorback has a compartment where you can stash power weapons, detached turrets, or even fusion coils or objectives.<\/p>\n<p>What appealed the most to me was the Academy, a new location within multiplayer that acts as both a tutorial area and a warm-up range for playing. These features have become gradually more and more commonplace in games, and seeing <em>Halo<\/em> implement onboarding tools, built-in warm-up areas, and bots for <em>Infinite <\/em>is a good sign to me.<\/p>\n<p>343 Industries also confirms there are no loot boxes, and there will be a Battle Pass, though it will never be taken away. As described in the video, it sounds like there will be Battle Passes with seasonal updates, but Passes won’t be “taken away.” As new ones come out, you’ll be able to purchase old ones and elect which Passes to put progression towards, which is a nice way of ensuring a good skin or cosmetic doesn’t pass players by.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, today’s showcase seemed like a solid overview of what’s coming in the new <em>Halo <\/em>multiplayer suite. <em>Halo Infinite <\/em>is still aiming for a holiday launch later this year on Xbox and PC.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n <\/div>\n<div>\n<article>\n\t\t\t<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/visco-collection-tomaday-arcade-retro.jpg\" alt=\"visco collection captain tomaday retro rerelease\" \/>\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h2>What do you mean ‘Who’s Captain Tomaday?’<\/h2>\n<p>The retro-lovers over at QuByte Interactive have announced a brand new compilation spotlighting the works of lesser-remembered ’80s\/’90s developer Visco Corporation — Now in development for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=j7lDgAJ63Uc&amp;t\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Visco Collection<\/em><\/a> offers a look back at some old-school arcade\/Neo Geo releases.<\/p>\n<p>The new compilation bundles together seven titles from the Visco archives, freshly emulated by indie developer PixelHeart.

                "textplain": "\n\n\n \n\nThe bots are back\nFollowing yesterday’s appearance in the Xbox &amp; Bethesda E3 showcase, 343 Industries showcased a little more of Halo Infinite‘s multiplayer today in a new overview. And we actually got a fair bit of info, not just in gameplay, but in what’s coming for the new look of Halo multiplayer.\nHalo Infinite multiplayer will be a free-to-play experience (as has been previously announced) for PC and Xbox. Alongside what you might expect from a usual Halo experience, like power weapons and vehicles, there are some new tools for destruction too; the grappling hook obviously changes up momentum, and you can also see points where the player grapples a hammer or power-up to themselves to pick up.\n\nEquipment is also back, as is the Razorback, the Warthog’s sturdier cousin. The back of the Razorback has a compartment where you can stash power weapons, detached turrets, or even fusion coils or objectives.\nWhat appealed the most to me was the Academy, a new location within multiplayer that acts as both a tutorial area and a warm-up range for playing. These features have become gradually more and more commonplace in games, and seeing Halo implement onboarding tools, built-in warm-up areas, and bots for Infinite is a good sign to me.\n343 Industries also confirms there are no loot boxes, and there will be a Battle Pass, though it will never be taken away. As described in the video, it sounds like there will be Battle Passes with seasonal updates, but Passes won’t be “taken away.” As new ones come out, you’ll be able to purchase old ones and elect which Passes to put progression towards, which is a nice way of ensuring a good skin or cosmetic doesn’t pass players by.\nOverall, today’s showcase seemed like a solid overview of what’s coming in the new Halo multiplayer suite. Halo Infinite is still aiming for a holiday launch later this year on Xbox and PC.\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tWhat do you mean ‘Who’s Captain Tomaday?’\nThe retro-lovers over at QuByte Interactive have announced a brand new compilation spotlighting the works of lesser-remembered ’80s\/’90s developer Visco Corporation — Now in development for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, Visco Collection offers a look back at some old-school arcade\/Neo Geo releases.\nThe new compilation bundles together seven titles from the Visco archives, freshly emulated by indie developer PixelHeart. The game featured are Neo Geo shmup Andro Dunos (1992); futuristic sports game Flip Shot (1997) and its sequel Bang Bead (2000); side-scrolling actioner Ganryu (1999); rally racer Neo Drift Out (1996), soccer title Goal! Goal! Goal! (1995); and finally the bizarre, tomato-based shmup Captain Tomaday (1999).\n\nNo further details have been announced, so we do not know whether the collection will include online play, save states, a museum mode, or any of the other features typical of other retro collections — such as Capcom Arcade Stadium. There are some fun titles bundled here, though the only one I remember seeing quite commonly on the scene is Neo Drift Out. Importantly, however, Captain Tomaday is finally about to get his day in the sun, enjoying the fame and fortune that eluded the winged fruit during his initial run — smothered by the encroaching concerns of The Millennium Bug, no doubt.\nVisco Collection is currently in development for PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch platforms.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChris Moyse\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

Junker Queen, however, brings a much-needed tank into the mix, and has an attitude to boot. Her aggressive style is going to be really appealing to a lot of players, and her commanding shout (which buffs nearby teammates) is a cool callback to barbarian\/warrior playstyles. Her voice actor is also on point and fits the character well.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LGgqyer-qr4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Kiriko is a pretty cool support character, focusing on talismans (which can heal) and kunai as her primary source of damage. The classic intuitive <em>Overwatch<\/em> design is still present, as she holds her talismans on the left side of the screen (left-click) and her kunai on the right (right-click). She also has a snap-use protection charm that can make a group of teammates invulnerable for a brief moment; and sports killer traversal skills with a teleport that goes directly to an ally, and wall-climbing capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Her ultimate is a bit like Hanzo’s Dragonstrike, but this time it’s a kitsune that grants beneficial effects for her team. She’s interesting because she can change a single push with a well-timed invulnerability charm and her ultimate. Plus, I love climbing around every level, including all the old ones, with her wall-crawling. For me, the gameplay mostly checks out. Now it’s time to venture into darker territory.<\/p>\n<p>The Season Pass reward track is actually much simpler than the confusing pre-launch info rollout made it seem. So presently, at least for the first season, there’s a single “battle pass” that has 80 tiers. Free players can get some rewards from it, and premium players will unlock things at every track. Purchasing levels (which some passes allow or disallow, depending on the company) is an option. Here is everything that comprises the first <em>Overwatch<\/em> 2 season pass free track:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Newest support hero, Kiriko (for new players who won’t have her already)<\/li>\n<li>2 Epic Skins<\/li>\n<li>1 Weapon Charm<\/li>\n<li>2 Souvenirs<\/li>\n<li>1 Highlight Intro<\/li>\n<li>14 additional items (emotes, victory poses, name cards, sprays, player icons, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Prestige Tier Titles (8 earnable titles available only after completing the entire pass)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And here’s what you get from the premium track:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Immediate access to Kiriko<\/li>\n<li>20% XP Battle Pass Boost<\/li>\n<li>1 Mythic Skin<\/li>\n<li>5 Legendary Skins and 1 Epic Skin<\/li>\n<li>3 Play of the Game Intros<\/li>\n<li>4 Weapon Charms<\/li>\n<li>3 Emotes<\/li>\n<li>3 Souvenirs<\/li>\n<li>6 Poses<\/li>\n<li>6 Name Cards<\/li>\n<li>30+ additional cosmetic rewards<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To buy into the premium pass each season, it’ll cost you 1000 Overwatch Coins, or $10. Characters, “if they are included in a season pass” (not all of them will have one, as the current plan is offering characters in Season 1, Season 2, Season 4, and Season 6), will be unlocked at level 55 on the free track [this season it’s linked to Kiriko], and are unlocked automatically after buying the premium track. There’s also a shop with a limited number of items that can be purchased directly for coins. Phew! That’s most of it. Annoyed yet?<\/p>\n<p>So there’s a lot of ways you can look at this. In short, it’s a lot like the<em> Fortnite<\/em> season pass system Epic created years ago, but worse. In <em>Fortnite<\/em>, players can earn premium currency directly from the pass itself, which will pay for the next pass. In <em>Overwatch 2<\/em>, you can earn coins elsewhere, but it’s expected that you’ll be able to pay for at least every other pass, roughly. For a free player, slowly clawing your way up the pass to level 55 to gain access to a new character is excruciating, even if Blizzard is locking them from ranked play for a token few weeks. For hardcore players, it seems like you’ll be dropping $10 a few times a year (with a nine-week cadence announced for seasons), which gives you instant hero access.<\/p>\n<p>Then there’s the other wrinkle of brand new players needing to essentially start over from square one: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/overwatch-2-new-players-unlock-original-roster-blizzard-news\/\">including the requirement of unlocking the full original core cast<\/a>.

It was the first new real IP from Blizzard in a long time, and from beta through the first few years, it was widely beloved by many, and even lead to a burgeoning (though late) eSports scene. But then the troubles started.\nOverwatch became staler as the team re-used the same events, and slowed with new hero releases. Critical team members left, and Blizzard was turned upside-down by some egregious activities at the company. Many games at Blizzard, Overwatch included, haven’t recovered from everything that happened.\nCan Overwatch 2 bring the series back into the forefront?

                "content": "<div>\n<h2>Why couldn’t this have been <em>Twisted Metal III<\/em>?<\/h2>\n<p>2012 was a pretty bad year. Your crazy co-worker was right, and the world was laid waste to by Mayans or something. Corporations were quick to rise from the ashes to monetize our misery. Big Daddy, for example, rebuilt the United States into a massive tourist attraction. Relive the days before the catastrophe in luxury and see the sights!<\/p>\n<p>But the gig economy won’t be kept down. Automercenaries compete to the death to show vacationers around the exploited remains of the country. Have you considered putting your life on the line to shuttle the bored middle-class around the newly veneered monuments of this dystopian hellscape?<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen_RogueTrip01.jpeg?resize=640%2C531\" alt=\"Rogue Trip Washington DC\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That’s my embellished take on the plot of <i>Rogue Trip: Vacation 2012<\/i>, though it’s rather accurate. It’s a vehicular combat game that actually involves giving tours.<\/p>\n<p><i>Rogue Trip<\/i> was developed by Singletrac after their contract with Sony expired and they were left without any <i>Twisted Metals<\/i> to work on. Instead, they took it upon themselves to further embarrass 989 Studios’ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/if-you-were-hoping-for-twisted-metal-iii-to-be-mediocre-your-wish-is-granted\/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Twisted Metal III<\/i><\/a> the same year as <i>Vigilante 8<\/i>. It has pedigree, with many of the developers from <i>Twisted Metal<\/i> and its sequel working on it. No, not David Jaffe.<\/p>\n<p>All the same, you can easily see <i>Twisted Metal<\/i> in <i>Rogue Trip<\/i>, they just added an extra twist to it. If you went from <i>Twisted Metal 2<\/i> to <i>Rogue Trip<\/i>, you’d probably feel right at home. The weapons all seem familiar, the controls are practically the same, and you know those directional pad combos that activate things like shields? Yeah, those are still here. And they still suck.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen_RogueTrip02.jpeg?resize=640%2C530\" alt=\"Rogue Trip Showing Elvis the sights\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The edge has been taken off. Sort of. Remember how the first two <i>Twisted Metal <\/i>games had an unsettling quality to them? <i>Rogue Trip<\/i> is a lot goofier. One of the characters is a chef that drives a hot dog. Another is a cross between Batman and Mickey Mouse. A swarm of angry poodles is one woman’s special attack. It’s not all flowers and good times, but it’s a heck of a lot brighter than Singletrac’s previous games.<\/p>\n<p>The other big change is in the economy. The tourists are there as a sort of a take on capture the flag. You need to grab them, take them to the various sights around the arena, and rack up some cash.

                "textplain": "\nWhy couldn’t this have been Twisted Metal III?\n2012 was a pretty bad year. Your crazy co-worker was right, and the world was laid waste to by Mayans or something. Corporations were quick to rise from the ashes to monetize our misery. Big Daddy, for example, rebuilt the United States into a massive tourist attraction. Relive the days before the catastrophe in luxury and see the sights!\nBut the gig economy won’t be kept down. Automercenaries compete to the death to show vacationers around the exploited remains of the country. Have you considered putting your life on the line to shuttle the bored middle-class around the newly veneered monuments of this dystopian hellscape?\n\nThat’s my embellished take on the plot of Rogue Trip: Vacation 2012, though it’s rather accurate. It’s a vehicular combat game that actually involves giving tours.\nRogue Trip was developed by Singletrac after their contract with Sony expired and they were left without any Twisted Metals to work on. Instead, they took it upon themselves to further embarrass 989 Studios’ Twisted Metal III the same year as Vigilante 8. It has pedigree, with many of the developers from Twisted Metal and its sequel working on it. No, not David Jaffe.\nAll the same, you can easily see Twisted Metal in Rogue Trip, they just added an extra twist to it. If you went from Twisted Metal 2 to Rogue Trip, you’d probably feel right at home. The weapons all seem familiar, the controls are practically the same, and you know those directional pad combos that activate things like shields? Yeah, those are still here. And they still suck.\n\nThe edge has been taken off. Sort of. Remember how the first two Twisted Metal games had an unsettling quality to them? Rogue Trip is a lot goofier. One of the characters is a chef that drives a hot dog. Another is a cross between Batman and Mickey Mouse. A swarm of angry poodles is one woman’s special attack. It’s not all flowers and good times, but it’s a heck of a lot brighter than Singletrac’s previous games.\nThe other big change is in the economy. The tourists are there as a sort of a take on capture the flag. You need to grab them, take them to the various sights around the arena, and rack up some cash. If another driver gets hold of them before you do, you either destroy them or use a weapon to eject the tourist and grab them before someone else.\nMake no mistake, however, the name of the game is still to be the last one standing. It’s not a complete reinvention of the genre. The money can just be used to repair your vehicle and upgrade your weapons. If you want to just go ham on your opponents and throw whatever you can grab, I’m not sure that’s the soundest strategy, but have at it.\n\nYou travel from Washington D.C. to Las Vegas. Grotesque versions of them, anyhow. Big Daddy generally features heavily in the scenery. It’s his America, after all. This game suddenly feels quite topical.\nThe levels are, thankfully, more of Twisted Metal 2 quality than Twisted Metal III’s dismal offerings. They provide the same sort of opportunities for destruction, though I don’t remember seeing anything as awe-inspiring as blowing up the Eiffel Tower. Still, the very fact that you need to show a tourist around ensures that there are interesting things to fill your eyeballs up with.\nOne deficiency it has against the Twisted Metal games is arguably its cast of characters. Twisted Metal seemed to have something for everyone — bizarre, creepy, heroic, villainous, cool, stupid — Rogue Trip is mostly just bizarre and stupid. A flamboyant wrestler, a sexy nun, a grotesque Elvis. You’ll probably pick the guy who drives the weiner-mobile, because when all you have is weird to pick from, you might as well go for the weiner.\n\nRogue Trip doesn’t really do anything new for the genre, which is probably why it got buried by Vigilante 8. The tourists don’t really add all that much. You don’t want to completely discard that little divet of gameplay, but I never really used the weapon upgrade system. I usually just kept my cash for repairing my vehicle.\nThe soundtrack is going to divide people because it heavily features ska. The Mighty Might Bosstones are pretty prominent, to give you an idea of what you’re looking at. I personally don’t mind ska, but I know some people look at it as sewage flung from a trumpet, so I feel I should at least offer a warning. You could always crank down the music and listen to, I don’t know, Rob Zombie.\n\nIn a perfect world, Twisted Metal III would have been shunned completely and a pedestal would be erected for Rogue Trip. It’s not perfect, but in the absence of an actual good Twisted Metal title in 1998, it deserved the attention. That’s just the power of the brand, I guess. This was the height of the vehicular combat genre, and while Rogue Trip wasn’t the apex, it definitely belongs at the cool kids’ table.\nIt’s really worth playing if you enjoy the ‘90s era of vehicular combat games.

                "textplain": "\n\n\n \n\nThe 2022 Nintendo Direct Mini is at 9AM ET on June 28\nWell, it’s happening! Sorta! It’s not the full Nintendo Direct that was predicted by some on June 29 — rather, it’s a Nintendo Direct Mini on June 28. That’s at 9AM ET, actually, and the publisher says it’ll be happening here when the time comes.\nAgain, it’s important to note that this isn’t a first-party Direct, and to set your expectations accordingly. Here is the full descriptive rundown of the Nintendo Direct Mini that we got directly from Nintendo:\n“Watch on-demand via our YouTube channel starting at 6 a.m. PT \/ 9 a.m. ET on June 28 for roughly 25 minutes of info on upcoming third-party Nintendo Switch games.”\nSo on paper, we’re not getting updates on Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 or Metroid Prime 4…yet. Or an update on when Advance Wars might come out on Switch for that matter.\n25 minutes is a fairly meaty timeframe, in any case, so we should see at least one big third-party announcement. I assume a lot of you will be doing avid amounts of research as to what a Nintendo Direct Mini actually entails, and we did a lot of the legwork already! You can check this out to get an idea of what a Direct Mini could look like.\nThe company was smart to move this away from the Summer of Gaming\/to-E3-or-not-to-E3 week and have it be its own thing. Even if it doesn’t include first-party updates, all it takes is one megaton announcement (something exclusive akin to Shin Megami Tensei V) to make waves.\n\n\n \n\nReviews Director, Co-EIC - Chris has been enjoying Destructoid avidly since 2008. He finally decided to take the next step, make an account, and start blogging in January of 2009. Now, he's staff!\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tOverwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs\nNetflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.\nThe new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.\n\nIn addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service.

                "textplain": "\n\n\n \n\nAnd what will be left of them?\nSupermassive Games is gearing up for the launch of The Devil in Me, the fourth and final episode in the first season of its scary, (and highly enjoyable) anthology series, The Dark Pictures. Publisher Bandai Namco released a new trailer, focusing on the hapless folk treading, foolhardily, into The Curator’s world.\nThe Dark Pictures: The Devil in Me will tell a tale of a party of documentary makers who find themselves invited to a modern replica of the “The Murder Castle” — the opulent estate of America’s first publicized serial killer H. H. Holmes. Seeing this as the opportunity to make the ultimate true crime document, our young protagonists jump at the opportunity, unaware of the horrifying, twisted plans that lay in store…\n\nThe trailer introduces heroes Charlie, Kate, Mark, Jamie, and Erin, with quick glimpses offered of a mysterious, cloaked killer and, of course, The Curator himself. Of all The Dark Pictures titles to date, The Devil in Me looks set to be the most “slasher” based, perhaps eschewing the supernatural and\/or monster-based terror of its predecessors. Horror fans will also spot numerous familiar themes and references, from a Shining-esque bar and a Tourist Trap range of animatronics, to Saw-style “death traps” and the Giallo overtones of the villain themselves.\nThe Devil in Me will represent the culmination of The Dark Pictures‘ first season, which has bombarded us with a frenzied party of pain and jump-scares over the past four years. Still, with a whole host of previously trademarked titles, and sales still riding relatively high, we can be sure that there are many more thrills and spills currently in the works within the gleefully grotesque minds of Supermassive Games.\nThe Dark Pictures: The Devil in Me launches November 18 on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox platforms.\n\n \n\nSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.

Twitter: @ChrisxMoyse\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tA new interface is coming to the PC-TV setup\nValve is planning to update its Big Picture viewing mode with the new interface it designed for the Steam Deck. The Steam manufacturer has the new user interface on the beta right now.\nThis update was announced a while ago, but it looks like it could be rolling out soon. Already, the feature is available in the Steam client through its beta options.\nAs detailed in a news post, you just need to opt into the Steam Client beta. Then, head over to the properties and add the “-gamepadui” launch parameter. There’s also a forum open for feedback.\n\nBig Picture is Valve’s special set-up for users who want a Steam UI that’s more conducive to a TV set-up. And since that often entails a gamepad in hand, the Steam Deck UI does seem like a good fit.\nThe updated Big Picture mode now includes a new Home Screen, a Universal Search, and optimized Steam Store for controller navigation.\nA new configurator should make it easier for adjusting and creating custom controller configurations. And updated game overlay, system menu, and quick access menu should hopefully make jaunting around Steam’s interfaces easier.\nA new lens\nI’ve been spending more and more time using my Steam Deck, and have also used the old Steam Big Picture UI a fair bit, and have to say: this all feels like a good upgrade.\nThe user interface certainly isn’t the sole reason that Steam Decks are becoming pretty darn popular, but the general experience on them is solid. I’ve had little trouble navigating its menus or finding what I need to.\nSo for those who play PC on the TV or still have a Steam Link stashed away somewhere, this is nice to see. The beta is currently live to opt into and test out for yourself.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n \n",

Agent 47’s new undertaking is now aiming to launch on January 26, 2023.\nA new blog from IO Interactive details the roadmap ahead for Hitman 3: Freelancer, in a series it’s calling Road to Freelancer. The Hitman developer plans for several updates between now and January 26, including a closed technical test.\nOn October 6, a new patch and roadmap will arrive for Hitman 3. Another update on October 27 will have details about when the Hitman 3: Freelancer closed technical test will start and how to get access.\nThen, in November, IO plans to host the test. More updates will arrive between then and January 26, when the game mode goes live.\n\nFreelancer was originally planned for earlier this year, but has faced a few delays along the way. Hitman 3 has still been seeing some content roll out though, with its latest location Ambrose Island dropping in July.\nA new way to play\nThe upcoming Freelancer mode is being billed as a roguelike adaptation of the Hitman formula. In it, Agent 47 will have a safehouse and series of contracts to carry out. Loadouts and mission planning can be set up in advance, and equipment can be acquired or lost in the field.\nThis mode seems like a way to not just test out veteran Hitman players, but to add some interesting wrinkles and challenges to the existing map pool.

During this afternoon’s State of Play stream, Housemarque announced <em>Returnal: Ascension<\/em> — a new challenge tower, and co-op support, are arriving on March 22 with the 3.0 update.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ZsVRtrRsUBk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>To quickly touch on the “endless” content, there’s a new how-far-can-you-get activity called the <strong>Tower of Sisyphus<\/strong> that’s playable after you’ve gotten the Icarian Grapnel (grapple hook) after beating the second boss. According to Sony, this is “an ascending gauntlet of increasingly dangerous phases, with each containing twenty floors.”<\/p>\n<p>You’ll need to clear out “all the enemies on each floor and secure your passage to the next one up.” It’s essentially a score-chasing arcade experience with a multiplier (which used to be Housemarque’s wheelhouse), with some “new narrative content to be explored.”<\/p>\n<p><strong>Co-op<\/strong> is also coming on March 22, but it’s specifically for the main <em>Returnal<\/em> campaign — so the “Tower of Sisyphus, House sequences, and Challenge Mode” are excluded.<\/p>\n<p>“By accessing the <strong>Chronosis portal near the crash landing<\/strong> (and in other select parts of the game), you’ll have the option to either <strong>host or join a public cycle<\/strong>. Or, if you’d like to share the experience with a friend, you can also choose to <strong>host a private cycle<\/strong> instead,” <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2022\/03\/09\/returnal-ascension-update-adds-co-op-and-tower-of-sisyphus-mode\/\" target=\"_blank\">Housemarque explained<\/a> in a post-show announcement on the PlayStation Blog.<\/p>\n<p>“If players get too far apart, they will be tethered back together. This is to ensure that the focus remains on cooperative gameplay and both players feel connected to the fates of each other. If one of the players is downed, there is still hope: the other one has the option to revive them.”<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/www.destructoid.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Returnal-co-op-gameplay.jpg?resize=640%2C360\" alt=\"Returnal co-op screenshot\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Tethering concerns aside, my mind also went straight to co-op progression.<\/p>\n<p>Here’s the rundown: “<strong>Progression is tied to the host<\/strong>, so if you’re struggling to overcome a certain boss or biome, bringing in another player to help may open your road to triumph.

                "textplain": "\nI was starting to fear the worst\nMuch to fans’ delight, Returnal isn’t done yet. They’ve been clamoring for more content, especially after a recent Twitter teaser, and it’s actually coming this month. During this afternoon’s State of Play stream, Housemarque announced Returnal: Ascension — a new challenge tower, and co-op support, are arriving on March 22 with the 3.0 update.\n\nTo quickly touch on the “endless” content, there’s a new how-far-can-you-get activity called the Tower of Sisyphus that’s playable after you’ve gotten the Icarian Grapnel (grapple hook) after beating the second boss. According to Sony, this is “an ascending gauntlet of increasingly dangerous phases, with each containing twenty floors.”\nYou’ll need to clear out “all the enemies on each floor and secure your passage to the next one up.” It’s essentially a score-chasing arcade experience with a multiplier (which used to be Housemarque’s wheelhouse), with some “new narrative content to be explored.”\nCo-op is also coming on March 22, but it’s specifically for the main Returnal campaign — so the “Tower of Sisyphus, House sequences, and Challenge Mode” are excluded.\n“By accessing the Chronosis portal near the crash landing (and in other select parts of the game), you’ll have the option to either host or join a public cycle. Or, if you’d like to share the experience with a friend, you can also choose to host a private cycle instead,” Housemarque explained in a post-show announcement on the PlayStation Blog.\n“If players get too far apart, they will be tethered back together. This is to ensure that the focus remains on cooperative gameplay and both players feel connected to the fates of each other. If one of the players is downed, there is still hope: the other one has the option to revive them.”\n\nTethering concerns aside, my mind also went straight to co-op progression.\nHere’s the rundown: “Progression is tied to the host, so if you’re struggling to overcome a certain boss or biome, bringing in another player to help may open your road to triumph. Client players who join to help will also get to keep some progress they make — such as collecting logs and xenoglyphs — and the more games they assist with the more their Scout Rank will grow.”\nI’m super curious how online co-op will be balanced (in terms of damage, health, enemy spawns, etc.), as this is a really tricky game for some of us. I actually made an effort to try and finish Returnal recently, but then Elden Ring consumed my life. I’m glad it’s still installed on my PS5 with the Ascension update incoming in under two weeks.\n“This was our effort towards expanding the lasting power of Returnal, and we hope to see players engage with our new modes for years to come,” said game director Harry Krueger.\n\n \n\nJordan is a founding member of Destructoid and poster of seemingly random pictures.

Still, that’s the DGG Halloween trilogy to a tee: Remember that? Here it is again! (also, mobs are bad). I saw Halloween Ends. I don’t hate it like most hate it, but it does feel like a film made while the crew was giggling and saying “The fans will be SO mad!”\nHowdy friends, and welcome to this super scary edition of Whatcha Been Playing? And by “super scary” I mean, “It was really scary on Tuesday when a flood completely ruined my kitchen and made me cry”. I appreciate the support lent to me in Qposts and social media, and repairs are currently in process. It was a nightmare, and I had to move out for a bit, but it could have been so much worse, and we all have to be grateful for the small mercies.

The Bethesda launcher is no more by the time May 2022 hits, and you can transfer to Steam a month early in April.<\/p>\n<p>Here’s the gist, and the bolded part is important:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>“We’re saying goodbye to the Bethesda.net Launcher this year. We would like to thank you for your support and assure you that all of your games are safe. If you’re not playing PC games through the Bethesda.net launcher then your work is done here. Thanks for reading! If you do have games through the Bethesda.net launcher, don’t worry. Starting in early April you’ll be able to migrate your games and Wallet to your Steam account. For more details on what this process will look like, read on. You have plenty of time to plan and begin migrating your Bethesda.net library to your Steam account. <strong>The migration to Steam will include your game library and Wallet – meaning you will not lose anything from your Bethesda.net account<\/strong>.”<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Basically everything will transfer from the Bethesda launcher. Saves, character progress for <em>Fallout 76<\/em>, atoms (microtransaction currency), seasonal progress, friends lists, the works. The only game saves that cannot transfer, curiously, involve <em>Wolfenstein Youngblood<\/em>. This seems to be as painless as possible, which is a huge plus.<\/p>\n<p>If you’re impacted, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bethesda.net\/en\/article\/2RXxG1y000NWupPalzLblG\/sunsetting-the-bethesda-net-launcher-and-migrating-to-steam\">you can find the entire article here with all the details<\/a>. <em>Fallout 76<\/em> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/fallout.bethesda.net\/en\/article\/FfWIVEmUL8vXXpAtkYnCT\/farewell-bethesda-net-launcher-fallout-76-faq\">has its own FAQ here<\/a>, which is relevant because <strong>testing took place<\/strong> in the Bethesda launcher exclusively.

                "textplain": "\nExtra launchers are like per-channel streaming services: not needed\nAnother launcher bits the dust. The Bethesda launcher is no more by the time May 2022 hits, and you can transfer to Steam a month early in April.\nHere’s the gist, and the bolded part is important:\n“We’re saying goodbye to the Bethesda.net Launcher this year. We would like to thank you for your support and assure you that all of your games are safe. If you’re not playing PC games through the Bethesda.net launcher then your work is done here. Thanks for reading! If you do have games through the Bethesda.net launcher, don’t worry. Starting in early April you’ll be able to migrate your games and Wallet to your Steam account. For more details on what this process will look like, read on. You have plenty of time to plan and begin migrating your Bethesda.net library to your Steam account. The migration to Steam will include your game library and Wallet – meaning you will not lose anything from your Bethesda.net account.”\nBasically everything will transfer from the Bethesda launcher. Saves, character progress for Fallout 76, atoms (microtransaction currency), seasonal progress, friends lists, the works. The only game saves that cannot transfer, curiously, involve Wolfenstein Youngblood. This seems to be as painless as possible, which is a huge plus.\nIf you’re impacted, you can find the entire article here with all the details. Fallout 76 has its own FAQ here, which is relevant because testing took place in the Bethesda launcher exclusively. According to the publisher, “going forward, playtesting for all future PTS phases will only be available on PC through Steam.” Again, easy!\nAs for the closure; competition is good, in theory. Steam is a monolith, and if someone wants to come along and provide products in a different way, with advantages (like how GOG provides DRM-free games), so be it.

The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/10\/18\/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california\/?guccounter=1\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch Disrupt.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch.

                "textplain": "\n\n\n \n\nNo hit, Herlock\nToday’s Capcom showcase for E3 2021 was mostly what it laid out ahead of time: a few spotlights on its upcoming slate of games, and some announcements of forthcoming plans for Resident Evil Village and Monster Hunter Rise. There was also a big breakdown of what’s to come with the western launch of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles, and folks, I’m very ready for more attorney action.\nA new features trailer shown today highlighted the aspects of legal battles new to The Great Ace Attorney, specifically the Dance of Deduction and Summation Examination. Both the collaboration with ace investigator Herlock Sholmes (yes, Herlock Sholmes) and persuading the jury in court proceedings add some interesting layers to The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles.\n\nThe Summation Examination seems like a neat test of logic and reasoning, but I absolutely loved the segment with Herlock and protagonist Ryunosuke deducing that this bearded man was, in fact, someone in a disguise. After highlighting the golden locks flowing out from behind their hat, the pair strike poses in a fun bit of theatricality.\nI’ve tried before to convince friends that they should give this series a shot, and honestly, this trailer might be the video I turn to from now on. It’s a great slice of both the mystery and court aspects of the Ace Attorney series at-large, and also highlights what makes The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles in particular stand out.\nSafe to say I’m looking forward to solving many more head-scratchers when The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles hits Nintendo Switch, PS4, and PC on July 27.\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\tOverwatch producer on board for new SoCal digs\nNetflix Games continues in its efforts to boisterously become part of the gaming industry at large — The fledgling outfit has not only announced the opening of a brand new studio, its fifth developer to date, but is also currently looking into the possibilities of launching its own cloud gaming service. The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.\nThe new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.\n\nIn addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service.

In addition, a special anniversary book will launch on July 19, looking back at every release in the series — from the original  2002 PS2 release .hack\/\/Infection through collectible card title .hack\/\/Enemy. Unfortunately, Bandai Namco did not announce any plans to localize these re-releases for western fans.\n\nA special exhibition will also be installed at Yurakucho Marui in Chiyoda, Tokyo between the dates of August 9 and August 28, 2022. The installation will feature original concept artwork and other audio\/visual elements celebrating the multimedia franchise. In December, a second commemorative anniversary book will also be released, alongside a special three-CD set of .hack‘s evocative and melodramatic score.\nBut what in the way of new games? Well, Bandai Namco has not offered any such reveal, or even the announcement of a reveal, but mystery still surrounds the “Last Recollection” trademark, which the publisher filed back in April of this year. It is believed that this pertains to an as-yet-unannounced set of the four mainline titles in the .hack franchise, namely .hack\/\/Infection, .hack\/\/Mutation, .hack\/\/Outbreak, and finally .hack\/\/Quarantine. So just sit tight for new news, hack squad.\n\n \n\nSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s. Former Saturday Night Slam Master. Graduated from Galaxy High with honors.

The news was announced by Netflix VP of Gaming Mike Verdu during a presentation at TechCrunch Disrupt.\nThe new development studio, which will be established in Southern California, will be headed up by industry veteran Chacko Sonny, who previously worked for Activision Blizzard as the executive producer of arena shooter Overwatch. Sonny left the publisher in the fall of 2021, one of a number of high-profile departures in the wake of the company’s Californian lawsuit and myriad toxic workplace allegations.\n\nIn addition to the reveal of the new studio, Verdu also noted that Netflix Games was “seriously exploring” the potential for a cloud gaming service. Verdu suggested that this service would be a “value add”, as opposed to its own distinct platform — This is clearly a distinct effort to distance the potential Netflix service from Google’s “Stadia” model, which announced its closure earlier this month.\nThe newly established studio, along with the exploration into the world of cloud gaming, represents the latest steps in Netflix’ efforts to carve itself a piece of the lucrative gaming pie. Already building a portfolio of in-house developers, Verdu surmised that the studio had 55 games currently in the works, with at least half based upon Netflix own range of IPs.\n\nFor the most part, Netflix Games has focused on the mobile gaming market — with gaming releases based on Netflix franchises such as Stranger Things as well as its own original titles — though it clearly has some serious ambition on deck.  Thus, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the company eventually branch out into producing more games for home console platforms in the future.\nNetflix to expand into cloud gaming, opens new studio in Southern California [TechCrunch]\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChris Moyse\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenior Editor - Chris has been playing video games since the 1980s.
